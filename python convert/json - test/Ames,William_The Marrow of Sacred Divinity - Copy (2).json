Becauft they Fell from the higheft top of excellency Secondly becauie in the Fof Angells all the Angelical nature did not perifli but by the in of the firft Man all mankind did perifti The Ap9flacj of Man is his Fall from obedience due to God or tranfgreffion of the Law prefcribed by God In this Fall two things are to be confidercd The committing of Uie tranfgreffion2 The propagation of it The committing of the tranfgreffion was accompliflicd in the eating of the forbidden Fruit which was called the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evill but the firft motion or degree of this difobediencc did neceflarily goc before that outward ad of eating fo that it may be truly faid that Man was finner before he had finifticd that outward aft of eating Whence it is that the very dclire which Eve was caried with toward the forbidden Fruit doth ftemc to be noted as fome degree of her fin Gen When the Woman faw that the Fruit of the Tree was good for Meate and moft delightfull to the Eyes and the Fruit of the Tree to be defired to get knowledge he tookc and eat Therefore the firft degree and motion of this dibbedienccj wsiS an inordinate defire of fome excellency by the lifting up of the mind which that fhe might attainc the forbidding of God being laid afidc through unbelief eflie would make triall whether the forbidden Fruit had fome ower to confer uch an excellency Hence was the grievoufiieffc of this fin which did not only containe pride ingratitude and unbeliefe but alfoby violating of that moft folemne Sacrament did make hew of as it were generall profeffion of dilobedience and contempt of the whole covenant AH which alfo were fo much the more foule by how much the condition of the hnner was more perfeft In so Mans Fall In the committing of this tranfgrcflion two things arc to be confidcredjthc caufeSj and confcqucnts of it Caufes were one principal And others adjuvant II The principall caute was man himfelfe bytheabufe of his freewill Bccleji For he had received that righteoufiieffe and grace by which he might have perfifted in obedience if he would That rightcoufnefle and grace was not taken fronrhim before he had finned although

fccond flight was in that he dcaic with the Woman iTimui Whether in the prefenccerabfcnce of her husband the Scripture is filent 19 The third flight was in that he determined nothing at the firft fpeech but only propounded certaine queion to the Womanas if he were ignorant of tbofc niattersHath God indeed faid 20 The fourth was that his queftion had much ambiguity in it for fo might be underftood that heftiouldnotaskeaf Gods command but of the fence or meaning of that command peradventurc not fufficiently underftood by nianj If the queftion be underftood of the command it felfe then he might ccm to have asked whether God had forbidden them that they hould not at all cat of the fruit of any Tree or as the Woman her felfc anfwcrcd whether he had forbid Jden them the ule of that one Treeand fo had notiimply given them leave for all 2r The jfift was that having firft called the command of God into doubt by that queftionhe did fo artifically extcnuat the fanftion of it or

Withthis tempting of the Dcyill thfitt it2i joyned the tempting of God whereby he did order that buliagflc that it might thence be manifeft what was in Man Ha But e2 ConfequenU of the Fall But this tempting of God WM neither Evfll nor tending to Evill 26 third tempting did follow thefc namely of Man towards God wherein he did in ccrtainemannermakc triall of the truth and Grace of God namely

For then the Divine nature hould take the properties of the humane and the humane fhould take the properties of the Divine and fo the humane hould be the Divine and the Divine the humaneor as well the Divine as humane hould ceafe to be Neither is it reall donation from which ftould follow that the humane nature might ue the Divine properties as its own inftruments But it is Communion or concurring

followcth the Communication of thefe properties as touching predication or attribution where by the properties of the one nature are attributed either to the whole perfon as when Chrift is laid to be

juftificationjthcy have ad judged to them lo Hence alfo the ccond difference followeththat humane adoption is only an extrinfecall denomination and communication of thofe things which are externall

The Prince of falvation He that fanciificth and they that arefanftfied are all of one He is not aftiamed to call them Brethren Behold and the children which God hath given mee 13 This application and

alfo alfo arc aid to be the firft begotten of Godt HebALti Ycc arc come to the uaiverfall aflTcmbly and meeting of the firft borne who arc written in Heaven 14 Whence alio it appeares that believers

created might be called ractaphorically the Son of God yet he was not the Son of God by this my fticall con junftion and communion with Chrift who is the naturallSon of God 15 Hence ariftth the third difference bctwcenc humafic adoption and divine for humane adoption was brotight in upon want ofa natural Son but the divine Adoption is not from any wantj but out of aboundant goodnefle whereby Iflccnefleofa naturallSon and my fticall conjunftion with him is communicated to the adopted Sons 16 That dignity which this Adoption brings with it doth not onely far exceed that common relation

abidech not in the houfe for ever but the Son abideth for ever 17 Hence the Name ofGod and ofChrift is named upon the faithfully by fpeciall right and rcafbn yfi 31 As Jacob taking the bns oflofeph

preaching of the Word the Will of God is propounded and really applied to beget and iacreafe Faith and obedience In the administration of the Sacraments the Will of God is alb perfonally applied by the calcs to confirme Faith and obedience In the exercife of Difcipline the Will of God is perfonally alfo applied in the cenfures for the removing of thofe vices which are contrary to Faith and Obedienc Hence it is that Difcipline is wont to be joyned with the Word and Sacraments by the beft Divines in the notes of the EcckJaJiicall DifcipUneoftheChurch for though ic be not notcfimply

contingent and in thii fence their fcntence is moft true 10 For feeing that in Lot fomc judgement isexpefted by the common confcnt of all and there is no power of giving judgement in contingent events neither is there any other fortune judging then the certainc providence of God itmuft needs be that this judgement be in finguUr manner expefted from Gods providence Neither can meerc contingency It

preparing of viftualls but when manna was by miracle fent from Heaven which ivas alfo by aiiracle prelerved on the Sabbath day And by the Hiftory of Chrift it appcares very likely that he did approve

is commanded in the tenth Commandementas appeares by the words themfelves neither is it any way meet that this Commandement be referred to that iiiward and original purity of righteoufncfle which is the fountaine of all obedience for that is not generally commaa dedinany one Commandement but in all neither doth it more pertaine to the ftcond table which is the condition of this precept then to the firft Yec becauic of all venues which are contained in the Second table there is none more internally or more intimate to primicive righteoufiieffc then contentionand we are it were lead by the hand from this to contemplate and eke that therefore that purity is not unfitly by occation of this precept handled here Unto this contentation is joyned joy for the profperity of our Neighbour as of our own Rom 1215 51n that contentment and Joy coRfifts the top and perfefti on of all charity toward our Neighbour In which refpeft alfo ccatentmcnt is in certaiac manner the pcrfeftion of godlineflc and godly man Tim 66 For godlmefle is great gaine pst duraild with contentmentor producing the pcrfeftion of contentment Hence it is commanded in the laft precept according to that order which proceeds from the more imperfecSttothc more perfcft and from that which is more known to that which is leffe knownc 7For this is duty moft perfeft and moft tinknowne to us by nature that whatfocver we conceive or will be joyned with the good of our Neighbouri STherc Therefore although this of its own nature hath the firft place among duties to our Neighbour as the foundadonof all the reft yet becaufe it is lait in aving being in man corruptedjtherefore ic is commanded in the laft place pUnto Contentation is oppofed coKupifcenceHi35 10 But by concupifcencc is not underftood the power and
