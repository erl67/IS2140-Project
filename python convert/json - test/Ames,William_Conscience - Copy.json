inftiued them foundly in the Truth ftirred them up effeftually to feeke after GodlinefTc made them fit for the kingdomeof God and by his owne example shewi them what things they should chiefely intend that they might promote true Religion in the power of it   unto Gods glory and others falvation And amongft other things which he Preached profitably hee began at length to Teach How with the tongue of the Learned one might fpeake word in due feafon to him that is weary out ofSfai by untying and explaining diligently CASES OF CONSCIENCE as they are called And the Lord found him Jo doing like faithfuU Servant Yet left he many behinde him affeed with that ftudy who by their godly Sermons through Gods affiftancej made fit to runne encreafeand be glorifyed throughout ng land My heart hath ever fince been fo fet upon that Study that haue thought it worthy to be followed with all care by all men Since alio Gods good providence fbdiipofingit that lived out of mine owne Countrey did obferue that in divers Churches pure both for Doctrine and Order this Praicall teaching was much wantingand that this want was one of the chief caufesofthe great negled or carelefTeneiTe in fome duties To the Reader duties which neerely concerne GodlinefTeand Chriftian life My minde was fet on as it were by violence to try at leaft in private whether were able to prevaile with fome young men that purpofe the Miniftry more to apply their mindes to this kinde of handling of Divinity whence no fmall fruit was to bee hoped for Being afterwards called to publike charge of Teaching in the Vniverfitie efteemed nothing better or more excellent then to goe before thofe that wereStudents for theMiniftriein this manner of teaching This part of Prophecie hath hitherto beene lefle praifed in the Schooles of the Prophets becaufe our Captaines were necefTarily inforced to fight alwaies in the front againft the enemies to defend the Faith and to purge the floore of the Church So that they could not plant and water the Fields and Vineyards as they defired  as it ufeth to fall out in time of hotte warres They thought withthemfelues in themeane while as one of fome note writes Jfwe haue that fingle and cleave eye of the off el if in thehoufe of our Heart the candle of pure Faith be fit upon Candlefiicke thefe fmall matters might eafily be difujfed But experience hath taught at length  that through neglect of this hufbandry famine of Godlinefle hath followed in many places and out of that famine grievous fpirituall plague  infomuch that the counfell of Nehemiah had need be praifed  namely that every man should labour in this worke with one hand holding in the other Speare or Dart whereby he may repell the violence of the enemiesThe fame Experience hath likewife taught that thefe fmall matters if fo be that fo neceffary things may beefo called are delpifed with no To the Reader  no leflc niadneffe then if one would fliffcr the fingers and toes of his hands and feete to beecutoflk as fome fmall thingswithout which he hoped to walke and ufe his hands well enough All things therfore being rightly weighed haue taken in kind God alio liking it as am perfwaded  thefe inftruions touching the power of ConfcienceNot that hope that any perfect thing in this kinde can come from me for there are more kinds of things this way then that certaine anfweiscanbegivenbymeatleaft to every one but that might doe fomething whereby the unlearned and fiich as are deftitute of better helpe might fomevhat be helped and that the more learned might bee fr excited to fet forth fome more perfed and exadi thing Of which duty the godly learned graue ancient Preachers are properly the Debtors  whofe dayly labour it is to deale with the Confciences of men  who through their experience haue learned much better what thofe queftions are in which the Confcience feth moft to doubt and out of what grounds they may be beft unfolded then can eafily be vnderftood by one  that Hues privately in an Academicall profeflion And tpdeede if inch things were handled in the meetings of Preachers according to the variety of Cafes that foil out and the more remarkeable decifions fet downe in writing  the children of Ifrael should not neede to goe downe to the Philiftims that is our Sutdents to Popish AuthorsJ to sharpen every man his Share his Mattocke

ferioufly trinrl Aft Of Confctence Booke fcience doth alwaies fuppofe an aflent that is firme and fctled By the definition of Confcience it appeareth that Confcience is not contemn  atiue judgement whereby truth is fimply decerned from falfehood but pratti call judgement by which that which man knoweth is particularly applyed to that which is either good or evill to himto the end that it may be rule within hiixv Whether Con tO dircdt his Will fcience be Fa     cuitie Habit  or Seeing that this name 01 judgement lslometimes taken for power and faculty fometimesfor an habit fometimesfor an ad this queftion arifeth to which of all thefe Confctence is properly The moft graue Divine William Terkins whe onely of our Countreymen hath fet foorth peculiar Treatife of Confcience  doth place it among Vacuities  andhe doth fb define it as he putteth for the general nature of it part of the Vnderftanding that is to fay as he explaines himfelfe natur all power or facultie  He giues this reafon of his opinion namely becaufe the ad of AccufingGomforting Ttrrifyinc cannot bee afcribed to the Confcience if it felfe were an ad But this reafon is eake becaufe in the Scriptur   sit fiich kindes of effeds are attributed to the thought themfelues which undoubtedly are ads Rom 15 Their thoughts Accufing one another or Sxcufng The reafon is becaufe things done are the effeds not onelyf of the Mover but alfo of the motio it felfe BefidesMa fter Terkinsmakcth GonfcienceVnderftandingOpinion KnowledgeFaithand Prudenceto be of one kinp or fort  but none would define thefe lb as that they should be

Confcience  yet it cannot be granted imply of all that which is fignified by the name of Confcience  for the onely office of an Habite as it is an Habit is Inclinare ad promote agendum to make one doe thing readily but Confcience hath other operations  which belong properly to it  as to Accufe Comfort By Judgement therefore in the definition of Con fcience underftand moft properly with the beft Schoolemen an aft of praicall judgement proceeding from the Vnderftanding by the power or meanes fa ahabit The ads of judgement are either fimple SX apprehenfion or difcourfe Whence it may be asked Dta  ettcu  to which of thefe belongs Confcience  It belongs to judgement difcourfing becaufe it can Anfa not doe its ad of Accufing Excufing Comforting unleffe it be through the meanes of fome third argument whofe force appeareth onely in Sy llogifmeby that which is deduced and concluded out of it The force and nature of Confcience therfore is Contained in fuch Syllogifme Be that Hues ininne

called Lighted Laws in regard of the AfTumption and  conclufion OfConference  Booke conclufion Witnejp but in regard of the afTumption it is mod fitly termed an Index or Booke and in regard of the conclufion mod properly Judge That which doth didate or giue the proposition is called Synterejis by the Schoolemen SynderefisJz afTumption efpecially and peculiarly is called Syneidefis the conclufieaisthe Krfis or Iudgement 11 There be maflyether Syllogifmes which belong to Confcienceas either they doe prooue the proposition of fuch principall Syilogifme or illuftrate the conclufion it felfe  but in that Syliogifme alone is contained the whole nature of Confcience The Proposition treateth of the Law the AfTumption of the fad orftate and the Conclufion of the relation arifing from the fad or ftate in regard of that Law The Conclufion either pronounceth one guilty or giveth fpirituall peace and fecurity Chap II Oft hi Synterejis oy for eh life ofTrinciples THat Synterejis out of which the proposition of this fyllogifme or the Law of Confcience is taken is moft properly habit of the under ftandingby whica wee doe affent unto the principles of moral aStions that is fitch adions as are our duty  becaufe God hath willed or commanded them whence it hath the name  in Greeke from confervinfor through the soodnefTe  QfGodthe knowledge of many things which wee ought to doe or shun are ftiil confeived in mans mind  even after his fall That expofition ofTriwhodreames that the Creekeword Synterefis ligaificsaCoeledion istoo l8sbandabfiird Be  Booke Of Qonfcience Becaufe this Synterejis is an habittherefore many doe call Conference an habit but it is onely the principle of confcience neither doth it make up any part of confcience but only as conference is in its excercfe This Synterefis is termed naturall habit in rcfped of the iightwhereby the underftanding of man is fitted togiue afient unto Naturall principles it is likewife called an acquiredhabit  in regard of the Specie or of the fuller underftanding of that whereirnto the understanding is naturally inabled and can fas it were under ft and prefently This Synterejis differs onely in refped or apprehenfion from the Law of Natureor from that Law of  Ood which is naturally written in the hearts of al men for the law is the obied zndSyntereJis is the obied apprehended or the apprehenfion of the obied This Synterejis may for time be hindred from adingJbut canot be utterlv extinsuished or loft Hence it is that no man is fo defperately wicked as to be void of all Confcience To Synterejis being taken after large fenfe ought to be referrednot onely generall conclufions touching right or Lawwhich are deduced by good confequence JMSut of naturall principles but likewife all pradicall truths whereunto wee giue firme affent through the revelation wee haue by faith Jl From hence arifeth the diftindion of Confcience into that which is Naturally and that which is Inlighte md Naturall Confcience is that which acknowiedgcth jfor law the principles of nature and the conclufions srifing from them Inlivhtened is that which doth befide thofe acknowledge whatfoever is prefcribed in the Scriptures The Scripture fometknes fpeaketh of this laft as Rent and fometimes of the other as Cor6S From hence it appeareth that the perfed and only rule of Confcience is the revealed will of Godwhereby mans duty is both showne and commanded For Synterefis in more large fenfe confiftethpartly of morall principles that are naturally in us together with their conclufions and partly of thole which God befides them hath injoyned But the revealed will of God whereby man knowes his duty containeth both thefe what it is that Hence it is that the Law of God onely doth bind bindes the Con  QfaCZ man  By the Uw   derftand that revealed will of God whereof we haue made mention vi as it doth alfb containe thofe things  which are commanded in the Gofpell 10 Tobinde In this morall fenfej is to haue fuch an authority as the Confcience ought to fubmit it felfe unto  And it wereafinne to doe any thing contrary to it 11 Henceit is that though men be bound in Confcience by God to obferve in due and iuft circumftances the lawes of men  yet the fame lawes of men lb far as they are mans lawes doe not bind the Confcience why mens laws 12 The Confcience is immediatly fubjed to God doc not bind the anc yi anc  therefore it cannot fubmit it lelfe unto Conscience   any creature without Idolatry 13 God onely knowes the inward workings of the Confcience  he therefore onely can prefcribe law unto it or bind it by one 14 God onely can punish the Confcience when it finneth Ihe therefore onely can forbid any thing to it Even apromife which in it felfe is facredj though though it be confirmed by an oath as it is an aft of man doth not properly bind the Confidence for the former reafons though men are bound in confeience by God to ftrickt and faithfull keeping of them For as it hath beene aid before of the lawes of men it may alfb in fome fort be affirmed of all covenants and other conditions which being madea man is bound to keep out of Confeience to God as for example the fickc perlbn is bound in Confeience to obey the counfell of  Phificiansforhis health But the receipts prefcribed by Phificians doe not binde the Confeience So againe Parents and Children are bound to mutuall duties  he that hath received benefit is bound to shew  nmfelfe thankefuU and the like may be faid of many pfbthev thingsj yet none of thefe either Parent Bene1 fdttor relationor benefit doe ofthemfelues binde the_  Confeience but the will of God in them Cha III Of the Office of Qonfcience  THe office of Confeience  if we fpeake withre ipe totheSjinterefisor Lawes of it is one in JecefTary things Another in things of middle and indifferent nature In neceffary things Confeience hath two acts To binde Tq inforce to praclife  Confeience bindeth according as it is informed  of the will of God for in it felfe

Confeience  it binds the whole whole man to obey and doe it prefently Confciencc bindeth man fo ftraitly that the command of no creature can free man from it Hence manas he maketh Confcience of the will of God commanding him fomeduty is in that regard called Debtor Rom 14 zfervant Rom 16 is faldtobzbound Afs 20 22 conjlrainedy Cor 14 to haueaneceffity laid upon him iCor 16 fo that he cannot doe

the forenamed places and phrafes  the ftrength and power thereof is declared Ier 20 Wherefore thought from  henceforth not to fpeake of him  nor to preach any  more in his name but the word of the

alfo are the Glory of God the Edifying of our Neighbour ahd the Helpe of our necenarie Actions 13 The power of this direction is Co great that it makes an action to be good which in its owne nature is but indifferent as on the other fide not oncly an evill direction but the want of good direction makes the fame aion to be bad Chap IV Of an erroneous Conlie nee Touching this dorine of the firft ads and offices of Confaencedivers queftions are mo ved which  being of great weight and moment for the directing of our Anions aright throughout our whole life ought of neceflitie to bee heere expedited though briefly jueft The firft queftion isWhether an erroneous Confcience doth bind  Anfw to unfold this queftion rightly thefe fiue things are bricfely to be opened What an errone  us Confcience is About what things it is conver se lant Whence the errour of Confcience commeth the generall differences of thefe errors Thefeverall waies of binding  An erroneous Confcience is either oppofed pri fl vc  vatiuely to good Confcienceo it comprehended every Confcience that judgeth not rightly when it bught even the doubtfull and fcrupulous Confcience alfb or pofitiuely fo it fignifieth onely that Conference that judgeth otherwife then the thing is This kinde of erroneous Confcience is diftinguished from adoubt cnce 10 Of Confcience Bookei doubting and fcrupulous Confcience by the firme affent it glveth though it erreth in giving it In this qucftion we fpeake of Confcience pofitiuely erring There are fome principles cleare and written in the hearts of all men that they cannot erre to obey and praftife them  fuch as this is That God ought to be lovedi Peyjurie ought to be efchewed no mans Confcience can erre in fuch like things as thefe or doe them againft Confcience man cannot loue God againft his Confcience Confcience therefore doth erre properly about conclusions that are gathered from fiich principles Theaufeofthe the error of Confcience comes either becaijje cpcfa  iat ar ticular conclufions are not rightly drawnV out of the generall principles Or becaufe thofe things  which God in the Scripture hath commanded us to beleeue are not fufficiently underftood Or finally becaufe the affent of Faith is not given to thofe things which ought to be beleeved though they bee under flood The caufe of this befides Gods fecret judge ments is either the not confidering of thofe things which ought to be confidered or fome evill difpofiti1 on which either keepes the minde from due inquir or averts it from judging rightly et The error of Confcience is either about the 4jfc or the rule of it The error which is about the rule  is either after the adion done or before it The error av bout the rule before the aftionbe done eonfiftsBither In that it judgeth that to be lawfully which is unlawfully Or in that it judgeth that to be unlawfullwhich is law full Or in that it judgeth that to bee bounden duety which either is unlawfully or but lawful oMtt tu To binde to things and to binde  are diftingui shed shed by fome Confcience is faid to bind to thing Obligare when its not onely finne to doe any thino againft it but alfb not to doe according to it Conference is faid to bind Ligare when one cannot lawfully doe thing whilft he maketh fiich Confcience of it One shall finne in doing againft it and finne though he doe according to it The fenfe and meaning of this diftinion is to be approved  as for the termes of it let the Authors thereof anfwer  To binde to thing   Obligare is by fome  in regard of the obj eft or thing bound to diftinguishedthus Out is either bound to doe according to Confcience erring or to lay afide that Confcience  But this diftinion is not exad becaufe Confcience Tbindeth not but fo farre as it doth diate or declare  thing  now no Confcience while it erreth doth declare that the error thereof is to be left Or that it felfe is not to be regarded becaufe it is erroneous Others put difference betweene that Obligation  whereby one is tied to doe what Confcience commandethand that wherby one is tied not to do the fcontrary But neither is this diftinftion alwaies good For if mans Confcience told him he might lie to faue fiis life he muft either lye or of neceffitie goe againft  his Confcience  Outofthefe grounds the queftion may bee thus JJ   jfwered Firft confciencethough erroneous bindes alwaiesfb that hee that doth againft it finneth The reafon is becaufe he that doth againft confciencedoth againft Gods will though not materially and truely  yet formally and by interpretation becaufe what the confcience doth declare it declareth as Gods will As For example He that ufeth private man contumelioufly taking him for the King not to be private manhe is interpreted and judged to haue done it to the Kinghimfelf fo likewife he that contemneth Confcience contemneth God himfclfe becaufe that which Confcience why he dwayes doth didlate is fuppofed to be the will of God Hence Tohis coniX ls  at   wa  cs fi nnet who doth any thing againft faen Confcience  but if the confcience doth not erre but the thing is as erroneous confcience fuppofeth then he iinneth doubly Firftin doing that which is ill in it felfe  and fecondly in doing it after an evill manner evill it  is in its owne nature and evill becaufe of the defpifing of confcience but if the confcience doth erre djaitwhich it doth is not evill but it doth it after an evill manner fb that the evill is pnely this namely the  contempt of Confcience rofronfci The error of confcience which is about an adion ence is  mt  that is the error which is about the obj tt or matter times worthy of about which anaction ought to be exercifed is either nonvoluntary and tlamelejje or voluntary and worthy  of blame If it be unvoluntary and blamelejfe then  confcience binds to do thing as much as if it did not erre For exampleIi man should verily beleeue fome thing to be his owne which is an other mans he may and ought in confcience to make ufe of it as his owne If one doe verily beleeue hee is his Prince that is in truth Tyrant  or that he is lawfull Magiftrate whfc indeedufurpes the title be is bound to yeelddue obedience unto him We haue an example hereof in Iaacob that went in to Leah that was none of his wifc whom he verily thought was his wife Rachel If the error be voluntary then it is to be judged of as an error is which is of the law or rule confci feooiCB Of Qorfcience Confaence erring touching the Lawe after the jfaff Inbeleeving that which it kith done well to be finne or contrariwife hath no power to binde in regard of that action which is part  becaufe binding and obliging haueever regard to future alons  and morali aion as the will it felfej is alwaies guided and informed by foregoing apprehenfionand not by that which followes after Hence no aion is made better or worfe for that confcience which is after it Yet doth this confcience fo farre binde through occafion of that which is done that one cannot lawfully goe on to doe the like againefo long as he hath fuch confcience viz fyat hee hath finned though he hathnotj in doing fo before Confcience through error judging that to bee awfull which is unlawfully as that it is lawfull for one jto lie  to faue his owne  or his neighbours life bindes indeed but doth not binde to doe Jo It bindes becaufe he that hath fuch confcience can neither lie nor abftaine from lying without finne Hee cannot lie becaufe this is fimply unlawfull Hee cannot abftaine from lying with fuch confciencebecaufe fiich manner of forbearance is forbidden by God   thouh forbearing it felfe bee commanded  for God requires not only that we doe good and abftaine from doin evill but likewife that wee performe both thefe with good confcience and not with bad one Such confcience doth not binde to doe what it faith Firft becaufe their is no obligation to unlawful tilings Secondly becaufe Confcience bindeth not to doe but by vertue of fome command of God but fuch conference is not grounded upon any command for the Law ofGod can neither incline nor bind any man to finne rtt finne Thirdly becaufe this error is alwaies afinnebut finne doth not bind to pradife it Fourthly becaufe fuch Confcience hath never Co fare ground as  that there needeth not further examination and inquiry into things Fiftly becaufe man is bound to lay downe fiich confcience for although that be not exactly enough fpoken which fome doe affirme namely That fuch Confcience bindeth man to lay downe it felfe yetitismoftcertaine that man is tied to lay downe fuch an erronous Confcience  for it is part of that old man whom wc are commanded to put oft Ephefqn 11 Confcience iudging that which is lawfull to unlawfull bindeth to abftaine from the pradife and ufe  of it Rom 14 23 The reafon is becaufe one may abftaine from lawfull things without finne 12 confcience iudging that to be bounden duty which is unlawfully binds but not to the pradife of it for the reafons fet downe in the ninth Thefis 13 confcience Iudging that to be bounden duty which is onely lawfull bindeth to the pradife of it  as for example If any mans confcience tell him that it is neceftary to uncover his hands alwaies when he prayes publiquelyHemuftprayfo becaufe lawfull things may be obferved conftantly without finne of rionc ObjeB If an erroneous confcience doth fobinde ens confcience that we may neither follow nor not follow it without finnethen there lies kind of neceflity of finning on thofe that do thus errewhich cannot ftand with the quity of Gods Law cAnfw This neceffity of finning when one is entangled by his owne erroneous confcience is not the fame both wayesw whether one do or do notaccor ding ding to confcicncefor if one do according to his erring confeience the fin is in the aion done  Ifhe doe what is not according to it the fin is in the manner of doing Itisnotanabfolineneceflitybutupon fuppofi  tionnamely if he keepe ftill fiich confidence which he both may and ought to lay downc This neceflity doth not flow from the nature of Gods law but is contraed and continued through mans fin for no man is thus intangled without his owne fault ueft Whether is it greater finne to doe whether 2tbe gainft fuch an erroneous confeience or to doe accor Ft CJin tOit gainft an erro Anjh We ought to iudge of the greatnefle of fm ence according to the quality of the thing which is to be done or omitted  as it Is in its owne nature and as it is apprehended by us If any man through errour of confeience should hold it to be an unlawful thing to goe to the Churchand feme God there which otherwife he is tyed to doej becaufehe knowes the Preacher to be lewd and naughty man and thinkesthat he shall be partaker with him in his wickednefle his finne is greater in flaying awaythen if he were prefent there becaufe it is greater finne to negledt Gods fervicethen to communicate with an others perfbnall  wickeclneffe in that fervice But if he should thinke it  unlawfull to be prefent at holy duties for Idolatry which he iudgeth will be committed there  he should finne more hainoufly if he should be prefent there be caufe the finne of Idolatry  is greater then negled of true worship In the firft inftance he fins more that followes his confeience then he that doth againft it but in this his finne is greater that doth contrary to it Opiruinte What opinion is 16 OfConfcience Booke

Firft in fuch things 3S are neceflarie to falvatioib and Gods worship no opinion can be fufficient though haue never ib great certainety of reafon becaufe Faith is required to thefe and Faith takes onely the infallible word of God In fiich things which are more remote from their principles diligent care is to be had that we alfo get certaine perfwafion  or beliefe of themout of the Scriptures  but if that cannot be obtained it is lawfull in our anions to follow fome fuch opinion is certaine and tried by the rule of Sci ipture Vfing alfo all diligence to bee certaine though webenotj it is

can at the fame time hauetwo contrary frob able opinions concerning the fame thing fo as he may lawfully leaue the one and follow the other jgnefti What shall one doe when his Confcience is doubtfull  Anjw For the declaration of this queftion wee muft obfeme Firft Confcience is faid to be doubtful in large fenfe as when the affent even of Faith or OL pinion prevaileth  yet there is fome doubting joyt ned But ftridlyand properly that Confcience is named doubting which yeeldeth to neither part of the queftion in hand but ftickes and ftaggers betweene  affent anddiffeht not knowing which to doe Touching the firft fort of doubting it hath partly beene ipoken in the former queftion and shall part ly be fpoken of in the queftion following Heere wee treat of that Confcience which in proper and ftrid fenfe is called doubting Secondly doubting is either Speculatiue or Praffi Af cuktiuc call Spcculatiue is that which is not immediately con doubt and verlant about pradiie or aaion as when one doubtI ethwhether this or that thing be his or notPrafficall  is that which immediately is converfant about fome particular adion Attfa Thefe things being laid downe it is anM fwered  Firft in all thole doubts which doe any way belong to our pradife diligent enquiry is to be made that we may clearely perceiue the truth and not doubt  becaufe while the minde remaines in dmbt the adion muft of neceffity want that perfedion which it would haue if it were done with Knowledge and certainty of judge menu ment For the more certaine our knowledge is touching thofe things which we doe the more confident we are in doing and more toy full when wee hauedone them Oft times it is lawful to do thingthough Jpeculatiue doubt remame becaufe he that doth fo doth not neceflarily doe either againft

becaufe other things being considered poflfeffion is  better ground to keepe it then doubting is to lcaue it  It is not lawfull to doe any thing againft TV tall doubt that is doubt whether the thing to bee done be lawfull The reafbn is Becaufe man cannot doe it of faith TLvmi 23 Becaufe he that  dorhfo Joth not fufficiently abhorre finne for willingly and wittingly he expofeth himfelfe to the danger of finning Becaufe he is not fully enough acjdidled to Gods will  for as he that doth that willingly whereof he doubts whether it bee acceptable to Jus friend or no doth againft the law of

part which if we follow it is certaine we shall not finne As for example man doubteth whether Vjury be lawfull or nor  the fafeft way is abftaine for herein is no danger of finning Som Some of the

certaine knowledge It hel peth much if it may be conveniently that the thinking upon thofe things be shunned from which fcruples may rife for the fancy being once ftirred  many thoughts arife  which cannot be fuppreffed againe without greate difficulty As we fee in Tyles that arc linked together in order if one happen to fall downe the reft will follow  and from hence are fcruples multiplied in timorous confciences Many fcruples when they cannot well be taken away by fome contrary reafon ought to be laid downe as it were by violence refufing to thinke or confider of them For fo long as fcruples are not actually apply ed they are not troublefbme  And fome befotroublefome that the weaker and more unskilfull fort can by no other meanes be ridd of them The bending of the mind

then before the iirftfinne of Angels and men  which was ia in the Will there muft necefTarily bee an error in the Vnderftanding and if fo then the punishment of finne should be before the fiift finne

the conclufion is gathered from the premifes This conclufion is an ad of Confcience whereby man applyeth unto himfelfe the Law of God which co ncerneth either his Adion or Condition This conclufion therefore dependeth partly on that generall Law which is pronounced by the Sjnterefs in the major Propofition  and partly on that  Reviewing of the adion or condition which is contai ned in the minor Propofition So that it gathereth together the ftrenth of the former ads of Confcience  and maketh xhzjudgement thereof perfed Like as therefore Confcience is Law in the mafor Propofition Rom 14 and in

according to th  Law So in the conclufion the fentence concerning man is pronounced according to his faff or condition by vertue of the Law that hath beene declared It is well defined therefore by

fpeaketh Rom 18 20 21 Andin David himfelfe Sam 12 who knew well enough what his moft evill fad deferved by law and like wife could not be ignorant of that which he had committed but halted in the application of the conclufion An example of the latter kind wee haue in all thofe Believers who repent truly yet for long time cannot apply Gods mercy to themfelues The caufe why Sinners doe it not are Becaufe they doe not confider ferioufly enough Gods law and their owne fadts for the conclufion proceedeth from the power  efficacy of the premijfis Becaufe they haue flat contrary conclusions in

man is either troabled in his mindor doth recaine his calmnefle For vexation of mind for the moft part which folfowes upon foule temptation is not onely no figne of their prevailing but is alfb ademonftrationofanftifyedhcart and quiet fecurity doth often time hew that the temptation hath prevailed The reafon is becaufe the opposition  which is apparent in this perturbation is figne that there is bme thing in the foule contrary to the temptation and quietneffe doth betray fome confenf For water is not troubled by the powring in of water but by the cafting of fire He which finds leaft trouble is in moft danger Luks   21 So Atjaniat and Saphira were quiet fff538 ButPtf found great deale of inward trouble 242 C0r12758 But  But if this trouble be fuch that it drives away man from

both extreams as the extreams agree betweene themfelves and thus no fubftanccs are properly things middle and indifferent by themfelves becaufe none of them are either good or evill but only aions and

from deliberate reafon as the rubbings of mens hands   id to cratch the head or beard to takeup ftraw while we ate thinking of fomethingelfethefe aftions are not morally good or evillthey want that which is required to make them fo  namely counfell and deliberation For although man may fin by thofeftions  as if in time of Prayer he fuffer hh imagination to wander  and do give way to fuch toyings

without any precedent aft of reafon  Neither are we bound any further by reafon to prevent them but only fo far chat they hinder not the duties we are about So for moving of the eye lids reafon and the will have power to moderate them but ic is not worth the while to take notice how often we winke if fo be we take heed that in fuch things nothing be done which isundecentor againft our duty 11Secondly every aftion which proceeds from deliberate rcafonand is properly called humane confidered Angularly and in the individual as it is an exercifed aftion is either good or evill For fuch kind of aftion is either ordered to good end or it is not  If it bethen it hath the nature of good aftion if other circumftaflcefc be correfpondent  if it be not ordered to good end it is an evill aftion becaufe it wants the perfeftionwbich ought to be in itand is not according to its rule 12 Yet is not required to the goodnefle of naturall aftion thatitbe alwayes aftually and explicitly referred to the due end fo that this be done implicity and vertuallybecaufe reafon in that exercife of fuch kinde of aftions may often with more profit be converfant about thofe objefts 13 Thirdly fome one or two circumftances of an human aftion may be indifferent as if one fcholler be peaking with another it is fometimes indifferent whether they ufe the Latine tongue or any other But their talke taken with all thee circumftances is neceffarily either good or bad the reafon is becaufe the determination of an aftion doth not depend upon one circuraftance apart but upon all jointly together 14Fourth 14Fourthly there may be forae lingular adion in which there is ho good nefle fpeciall to be found which may not be found in another andfo that at this time we doe this or that rather then another

although therefore there be no lingular anions humane that is neither good  nor evill yec there arc divers  which Angularly and in coraparifon of others are neither neceflary nor unlawfull For as the

Infidels and wicked men although by right they arc liable to bee deprived of this power being deftitute of that mere eminent title which the faithfull in Christ have obtained yet becaufe the fentence

they have lawfull and free ufe of thofe temporall things Quefh Whether or no and which way was the du ufion of Dominions lawful zA The divifion of things was both juft and neceflfary FiritToavoidcontentions gen 13 Secondly  That thofe things being in parts fhould bee more diligently employed Thirdly That they might more orderly bee handled  That divifion is founded not onely on

multiplication of mankind 6nd the prevailing oi iniquity to the more peacefull and quiet   ictling feeling of things And this was alwayes in the Law of nature which wee obferve at an ordinary table or

the Court of Confidence may be foundedon the civiUUro alone or the Divine law alone yr en both  10 The Confcicnce in all things ought to lookc back on the judgement of God Vnleffe therefore the title of Dominion is manifeft to bee lawfuiland true by the law publifhcd by God either in natureor in bis word it cannot itand in the Court ofConfcience 11 Properly it doth confider onely the judgement of God becaufe it is not fubjeft to humane Court If therefore it hall plainely appearc that the title is of force either in the law of nature or in the Divine law it gives true Dominion according to the Court of Conscience although it bee difannulled in the Civilllaw 12 Hence it is that hee hath uft and true Dominion which poffefleth any thing by contract which ather wife is law full and right but onely for the want of fome ceremony or formality which the civill law prescribes to acontrad in the humane Court is difannulled or to bee difannulled 13 tA So alfo Dominion is transferred in the Court of Confcicnce by will which is not formal id eft which wants certaine number of witnefles the Notary This formality is therefore onely prefcribed in the Civill lawes to prevent deceitpand coufening which are often ufed in fuch contracts but when the intents of thofe that made thefe contrafis doth manifeftly appeare that reafon ceafeth as alfo the force of the Civjfl law doth ceafe For when the

upon deliberate Counfell But the Civill law cannot abrogate the law of nature Erg 16 sj4 The intention of the Ciriillaw inditanhulling fuch contrafts is ondy not to hclpe them in the external Court or give fentence on their fides becaufe of the Common good How foever all obligation which arifeth from the Saw of nature isicfr ly 8The CivrH law it felfein fome cafes asin Sculdiers will 8cc Doth admit of this naturall obligation although itwantthofe formalities Therefore it doth acknowledge that thefccontrads inthcmfelves arc of force in the Court of Confcience 18 Therefore hee in whofe favour the law difannullcth fuch contrail cannot with fafe Confcience plead againft it before lulgc or require that it may bec declared nullified orofnoiorce if hee knowes the truth of it ip 10 Hence alfo the poffeffion of anothers goods the Lord thereof being unwilling although it bec  continued fo long as the lawes require to prefcription doth not conferre the Dominion to the poffeffour in the Court of Confciencc 20 11 If the ppflTeffion bee by deceitfull dealing Mft if the Poffeffour knowes or thintoes the thing poffefled not to bee his but anothers it is afinnc againlt the law of nature  and therefore cannot cftabliflb the right of Dominion And thofe lawes which allow fo much power to fuch kind of pofleflions tend to the deftruftion of the Commonwealth in that they nonnfti heavy finnes in detaining other mens goods againft Confidences and alfo allow theives the Dominion of ftolen goods onely for delay of reftitution which is manifeftly wic  feed iA 12 The poflfefllon of Bintfidei by

negligence in finding out the truth which excludes upright dealing is aiwayes prefumed of him that detaincs another mans goods efpecially ifhee were the authour taking it into his poffeffion 23 14

the irrternall Court ofConfcience The intcrnall forme of lawfull Contraft upright dealing by which one dothtinccreiy intend to obi ge himfelfe to the performance of that which hee profcffctb and afterwards toperforme it as much asinbim licth The reafon is becaufe Contraft includes promiflive confent Nowapronjifeisa teftimony by which one binds his faith to dcalcuprighfcly with another in the performance of this or that and therefore the forme doth require internal andeffentiall the upright dealing of the Contrafter to bee trucand fincerc 21 Hence that divifion of Contra As by which fome are faid to bee according to upright meaning others to bee according to the ftrineflfe of the law is n5t accurate and hath not place either in the Court of Confcience or before God For upright meaning is required in all Contras and becaufe the chiefeft part of the nature of Contaftsdothconfift in that the judgement as farrc as can appeare is to bee given out of that and according Ggg to ibti Therefore all Contracts wee hould proceed according to right and good not che letters or ctrcame rigour of the law in which often times the raoft extreame injury is found 33 Sometimes not to land to promifes is not repugnant to honeft meaning to wit when the promifc leaves off to bind  As firft If the thing promifed becomes unprofitable unlawful or lmpoflible Secondly If the ftate of the things

of the Contract 28 When this guile lights oncly on the Contract and is about its accidents as if one fliould bee deceived in the goodnefse of thing and is brought in by deceit not that hee ihould buy but that hee fhouldbuy for more then its value it doth not make the Contract utterly voyd or altogether to bee made voyd howfoever hee which deceives is bound in Confidence to recompence the others

another mild loweft cafie fwect according to the terme of parvity And the third meane or moderate as it receeds from either extrcame Queft Whether there bee tnyjstfi cattfes of varying tbe jufi pree  s4nf There arc many caufes given The firft caufe is fetcht from the confideration of the office of Merchant for it is valuable at price that heefpends his time care and thoughts in getting preferving and conveighing things and alfo that hee hires fervants infomuch that if Merchants were wanting the Commonwealth muft neccflarily provide publique Minifters to doe thofe things Hence the fame thing is valued at greater rate with Merchants then with other private men Yet Merchants muft not reckon all their charges they have laid out For it may oftentimes fall our that fo much labour is employed and fo great exoenfesbeftowed an unprofitable and unneccfTary thing and therefore the common rate is to bee followed Hence thole rules are dcceitfall by which Merchants ufe to juftifie themfelves in exacting greater pftce for their wares to that they bought thofe wares for for fo much that they Ipent fo much in procuring themv For it may happen that Merchant may fell cheaper then heeboughtjandyct fellunuftly  cither becaufchec bought it foolihly or afterwaids the rate of things is chan The fecond caafc is brought from the manner of felling from whence manifold variety may follow in augmenting or diminishing the price When the ware feekes out chapman it makes the jud price of thing to abate according to the common proverbe proffered wares ftinke The reafon ued to bee given is becaufc in that manner of felling fcarfity of buyers is prefumed by which thecommon vale is diminished  but that reafon doth not feemefugfcient in confeience for any notable diminution of the price except that alio happen that the thing which isfo fold is little profitable to the buyer or fach that hce would not have bought it but upon uch an occaionor that hee buyes not fo much for his owne as the fellers fake From this rule it often happens that goods which are at open falc or by the voyce of the publiquc  irycribarc leffe priccthcn other wife they ufe lit When Chapmen fekc wares For then the ftore of buyers augmentsthe common vale and fo is  uft caufe of augmenting the price When one fcls great quantity of things together and not by parcels this manner of felling diminiQicth the price becaufc it diminiflieth the number of buyers and alfo the power of detriment or danger of lofte which might enfuc upon occaGon of felling it ter 13 When one felsby parcels this manner may juftly augment the uft price of things becaufc there is more labour in felling and more care in keepin and dividing the wares 14 The third caufe is if the feller by felling hall futfer fome particular difcommodity although that difcommodity conlifts onely in the privation of fome ho5iour or particular delight For then the feller may exSa fome what of cmns bj rfifyi IP fotnewhat more then the thing is worth in it felfc and the price by accident will bee jult becaufe natural equity requires that the feller being hee is Lord of his ovvnc things  hould keepe himfclfe harmleffe 15 10 But thim lavvfuil onciythen when the buyer follicites the feller that hee would fell that thing which otherwife hee was not about to fell For if the feller freely offer himfeUe to the buyer then the buyer is not the caufc that hee is deprived of his ownecomnu dity Chan XLIV Of Contrttts by Vfmy Qucft   Vfftry Vfury by lending in this matter of Contracts is wont to bee defcribed gaine fought from the lone of money by force of the lone  itfelfe  By gaine is underftood the acquifition of fomc commodity which is valuable with money which was not mine For if any one fecke onely fricncUhipor good will it is not Vfury becaufe they are not of the number of thofe things which can bee animated at price If alfo one by lending hould eeke to receive that which is due by vertue of former contract and obligation it is not Vfury for otherwifebee would not receive his owne But if one hould not feeke money or wares yet homage or gifts or the impofition of fomc burden it is rightly called gaine by Vfury becaufe it is valuable at price si  It is faid by the force of the lone it felf to exclude that gaine which may bee received by fomc other title as for recompence of emergent ioffe or the ccafing of gaine The gaine of which kind is ufualiy called intereft and is diftinguiflied from Vfury This gaine is faid to bee fwght  not agreed Hhh upon upon becaufenot oncly re all Vfury in which Contract iriccrceeds but alfo mentU which is in the intention of getting againe from the lone as debt may bee contained in this description Queft  Whether this kindj0V fa Is tawfull Such Vfury which is commonly praifcd byi Viiirers and Baakcrs is defervedly condemned of ail becaufeit is catching arty and no regard of charity or equity being hadlayes in wait for othct mens goods But itcannot bee proved folidly byanynaturall rcafon that any Vfury whatfbever is generally and  folutely unlawfull Not by their realpn who fay  all loncs in their nature ought to bee of good will For it cannot bee proved that every kpic with
