    "content": "necesry gifts of Providence every senSfe hath something peculiar to itself which affords it com fort The eyes have beautiful colours to give them pleasure the ears besides ordinary have melodious sounds to delight them the taste has not only the suitableness of common food but the sweet ness of honey to please itf and the smell besides common odours has fragrant flowers to regale it Sinful or unholy comfort is the pleasure which sinners take in gratifying ther lusts or the delight which they have in abusing the gifts of Divine bounty Sometimes the true Christian is ready to wonder how wicked men can at any time feel themselves comfortable but he has no cause to wonder for tlieir very commission of sin is momentary comfort to their depraved nature It is as sport to afopl to do mischief The ecorners delight in their scorning Their soul delighteth in their abominations To commit iniquity is agreeable to their sinftil nature and therefore is comfort to it Indeed were it not for the frequent opportunities which they have of gratifying some lust either of the flesh or of the mind life would be an Insupportable burden to them Evil men saith Solomon sleep not exrept thoy have done nnschief and their sleep is taken away unless they cause some to fall All How inexpressibfy dreadful is the condition of that man to whose heart it is pleasure comfort to sin against holy and gracious God Sinful comfort also is the pleasure Prov 23 Piov 22 Isa Iqcvi jfrovu iv io A3 that selfrighteous persons take in relying either on their own righteousness wholly or partly on the righteousness of Christ and partly on their own for their justification and title to eternal life and the delight which hypocrites feel in reflecting on their counterfeit graces and attainments Spirihial or holy comfort is that inward solace or satisfaction which supports strengthens and exhilarate holy souls and which they have in and from the Lord Jesus their Covenanthead by the exercise of faith hope love and the other graces of the Holy Spirit or it is that spiritual delight that holy joy which cheers and invigorates the hearts of believerjs under all their inward and outward troubles It is this only that deserves the name of pure solid and durable consolation If it is comfort to the wicked man amidst all his afflictions to gratify his carnal and ungodly lusts it cannot sur but be real and even great consolation to holy man under all the trials of life to exercise his spiritual graees and to perform his holy duties The word Comfort is in Scripture used in twofold sense It is sometimes employed to exr press that which gives consolation but more frequently to signify the consolation itself which is received from it or enjoyed by means of it It employed in Scripture to express that which givesi or is mean of giving consolation to the soul of an afflicted believer whether it be per son or thing ki which by the blessing of Christ comfort is hidden and by which it is afforded or word or reason suggesting to the mind of thQ Romv Col ivKll Ps cxlx 76 CBristian matter of consolation Eacli of these styled Comfwt because it is mean or instrument of dispensing consolation to the saints dy The term is by the Spirit of inspiration mora frequently employed to express the consolation itself which believers receive whether by means of persons or of things or of reasons and which they feel or enjoy in their souls It is in this lat sense chiefly that propose in this treatise to discourse of spiritual comfort In order to illustrate the general nature of this inestimable blessing shall present it to the view of the devout reader under the following particulars Spiritual comfort usually supposes trouble of Eome kind either felt or feared or the prospectof some difflcuU duty to the performance of which the believer needs to be encouraged It is under affliction or uneasiness that the heart of the Christian needs to be comforted The Lord Jesus accordingly saith Blessed are they that mourn for they shall be eemfcrted He made the first promise of the Holy Spirit as Comforter to his disciples when in the prospect of his departure from them sorrow had filled their heart God says the apostle Paul comforteth us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them who are in any trouble and he styles him The God who comforteth them that are cast down The soul that it may be qualified for spiritual consolation must be quicken ed and humbled It is the spirit of the humble Ps cxix 50 Cor Msitt John xvi Cor Cur viL ft 4j and the heart of the contrite ones that the Kigff and lofty One will revive with holy comfort Indeed the oil of spiritual joy is such that no vessel but contrite heart can hold it The design of imparting Divine consolation to cheer and invigorate the drooping spirit The office of the Comforter is to relieve the disconsolate soul It is impossible for them who have never felt the uneasiness of wounded conscience to value or to desire the joy of Gods salvationThe soul that it may need and be prepared for true consolation must not only be quickened and humbled but be under some affliction either felt or apprehended Comfort according to an apostolical direction is to be administered to the feebleminded to such as are ready to staler under the cross and to be overset by the temptations of Satan aiid the world or discouraged because of the corruptions of their own hearts It is trouble that renders spiritual consolation necessary as weU as desirable If the believer were not feeble and incapable of being supported by created arm the office of Divine Comforter would be unnecessary If he had not painful as well as spiritual sense of his want of heavenly consolations earthly comforts would be more acceptable to him tharr they and if his heartwere not prepared for them by being humbled as well as afflicted they would no more refresh it than shower af rain would refresh rock Accordingly Christ seldom communicates sensible comfort to the saints but wheiv ihey are either in inward or outward trouble Isn Wik 15 Lam ul6 Thess lfc It Is by their being troubled that they become disconsolate and so become fit for being consoled and it is tlieir sharpest afflictions that often serve to prepare them for the sweetest consolations He therefore brings them usually into the wil demess before he speaks comfortably to them It may be proper here to remark that as Divine comfort is the opposite trouble so it must be more powerful and effectual than either outward or inward trouble for there is no prevailing but by that which is the stronger it must be more forcible to raise up the dejected soul than the grievance is cast it down otherwise it annot at the time be comfort to it There are three degrees of spiritual comfort the lowest degree is peace of conscience the next is joy and the highest is triumph Peace of conscience is that inward serenity or tranquillity of mind which arises from the faith and sense of being justified in the sight of God or of being in state of union with Christ and of conformity to him Being justified by faith says the apostle Paul we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ The peace with which the God of hope fiUeth the hearts of the saints is peace in believing It arises also Hos ii 14 Luther says that All tilings come from Christ to lit church in contraries he is righteousness but it is in sin felt he is life but it is in death he is consolation but it is in calamity Augustine likewise observes that the Christians life runs on between these two our crosses and Gods comforts Bom Koro xv 13 fronr tlie setise err consciousness of peace with Gotf When the blood of Christ is by faith applied to ihe conscience the conscience purged by it from dead works and the heart also is at the same time sprinkled by it from an evil conscience The subject of spiritual peace is conscience tliat is purged Purity and peace are connected together in the conscience and they are both necessary to render it good conscience When the conscience is sprinkled with the blood of Jesus it is thereby set free from the dread of reTenging wrath The mind is not as formerlyr disturbed with alarming fears of God indignation nor disquieted by his judgments This is accompanied usually with cordial acquiescence in the will of the Lord feunded on persuasion of his wisdom and soveieignty oi his holiness and goodness and so far as man attains this holy acquiescence in the Divine will he is secure from disappointment and free from uneasiness Now this peaceful serenity of soul is the first degree of spiritual comfort When the Lord Jesus would comfort his disconsolate disciples he said These things have spoken to you that in me ye might have peace Joy is higher degree ofholy consolation Spiritual joy is that gladness of heart which flows liom die lively excise of faith feasting upoi Christ in the offers and promises of the gospel Tlie apostle Paul prayed thus for the behevers at Rome Now the God of hope fill you with Heb ix 14 Heb 22 Tim jProv 53 Joha xvi 33 Rom xv I3 Ajoj and peace in believing and the apostle Peter said to the Christians of the dispersion Believing ye rejoice It is holy delight in living upon Christy and in walking in him and it is effected by the Holy Spirit shedding abroad in the heart like fragrant perfume the love of God When he graciously condescends to administer that reviving cordial it elevates and en larges the fainting souL Arising as it does from the begun enjoyment and from the hope of the full and endless enjoyment of God in Christ it strengthens and so comforts the drooping heart The joy of the Lord saith Neberaiah is your strength Peace is negative joy is positive comfort the former is as the calming of the storm the latter as the breaking out of the sun that is mitigation of trouble tiiis sense of positive enjoyment When condemned criminal knows that he is pardoned he has peace but when he is besides advanced to preferment he has joy Triumph is the highest degree of consolation The saints triumph when they so greatly rejoice as almost to shout for joy on account of the victory given them over their spiritual enemies They triumph when more than conquerors through him who loved themthey exult or rejoice in their almighty Redeemer with rapturous dehght This was often the attainment of the holy apostle Paul and of his fellowlabourers in the gospel Thanks be unto God says he which alwaifs csLUseth us to triumph in ChristV Pet Neb viii 10 Cor ii 14 A6 lofty description of this their triumph Se giveth in Rom riii 3139 Hbw high did heavenly consolation rise in the soul of that holy apostle when he was writing that sublime passage In like manner does the believer triumph when in his pursuit of more communion with Christ and eonformity to him he is enabled to vanish great opposition In some happy moments of his life his joy like river swelled by impetuous rains bursteth all its banks and carrieth all the joys and all the sorrows of this world before it It is then especially that it may be styled Joy unspeakable and full of glory It glorious in itself and is attended with glorying in the Lord Jesus When the heart of the Christian is elevated to this degree of consolation he glories in the Lord All that is in this world is brought under him the greatest calamities cannot daunt him He sete Christ and God in Christ against all enemies and all evils whether external or internal This triumphant glorying in the Lord is like that of the lioly Psabnist who said My soul shall make her boast in be Lord It is remarkable that these three degrees of spiritual comfort are by our apostle mentioned single passage We have says he peace with God through our Lord Jesus Chri6twe rejoice in hope and nolh only so but we glory in tribulations also Spiritual consolation is according to the covenant of grace given to believers by God the Fa tber by Christ the second Adam frndby the Holy Spirit God the Father giveth it by sovereign and Pet xxaIv Bom 1S jcrdiciary authority Christ the mediator by grai clous dispensation and the Holy Spirit by effectual operation God the Father ordainetli it for his children Christ the last Adam administers it and the blessed Spirit as the Spirit of Christ applieth it to them Holy consolation is given them by God the Fa tka None but Jehovah himself can pour consolation into troubled soul All true comfort is originally and fundamentally in Him He it is whom the apostle Paul styles The God of all comfort who comforteththe saints in all their tribulation and The Father who hath loved them and hath given them everlasting consolation He also calls him The God of consolation and The Comforter of those that are cast dowV The Lord compareth himself to father pitying his children and to mother comforting with tenderest concern her flicted infant He chargeth his servants to strengthen the weak hands to confirm the feeble knees and to say feo them that are of fearful heart Be strong fear not behold your God will come wkh vengeance even God with recompense he will come and save you He suffered his only and beloved Son to be in ail points tempted like as his people are that he might sympathise with and comfort them under all their temptations Comfort is administered to them by Jesm Christy Isa xxvi 12 Cor Thcss ii 16 Ron XV or vii Ps ciii 13 Isa Ixvi 13 Isa xxxv their Covenantbead The Lord Jesus is die Trustee the storehouse of all spiritual comfort to the saints from Hira as the hope set before them they may daily derive strong consolation Hence he is styled The Consolation of Israel He is the matter of his peoples consolation the Prince of peace the true Noah who comibrteth thein concerning the work and toil of their hands It is part of bis high office to which he was anoihted by the blessed Spirit to comfort them who mourn in Zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness There is therefore consolation in Christ and the consolation of the saints aboundeth by Christ they have it in him and through him with him and by him His person righteousness fulness and love are the source and substance of abun dant consolation to them iagmnst trouble of every kind He it is v9ho giveth peace to his people and when He giveth quietness who then can make trouble Nothing can comfort the heart without Christ He removes from the soul all that is dismal and bestows upon it all that is comfortable He it is who maketh even the darkness of trouble itself to be light before them who trust in him He is the Sun of righteousness whose light and warmth and healing cheer their souls When he vouchsafes his reviving presence to them he leaves delightful perfume of comfort behind him Indeed man can never know what true Luke 11 25 Im Ixi Phil ii CflTr Job xiv 29 pleasure is till he know Christ The compaa aionate Redeemer tlierere saith to aU who are weary toiling in fruitless pursuit of happiness and also to all who are heavy laden oppressed with the servitude of sin or bowed down under load of misery Come imto me and will give you rest Comfort is applied to the saints by the Holy Spi rit He is therefore styled The Comforter Being the inestimable gift of the Father through the mediation of the Son he is another Com forter The adorable Spirit dischargeth this his office by testifying of Christ or by taking of the things of Christ and shewing them to be lievers by opening and applying the promises of the everlasting covenant to them and by enabling them to believe these with application to themselves by shedding abroad the love of the Father and of the Son in their hearts by witnessing ta tliem their adoption and their being heirs of Uod and jointheirs vdth Christ by abiding in thenv as the seal the earnest and the pledge of their eternal inheritance and by dwelling in them as the Spirit of grace and of Supplications The Holy Spirit like Noahs dove flreth with the oliveleaf of peace to assure believers that the winter ispast and that the rain is over and gone He not only bringeth words of comfort to their remembrance but opens their hearts to receive them ComfcNTts may be so applied as to be brought close to the heart but if the heart do aot open for Matth nu 28 Joho xv 25 Johnxiv 16 thekn no consolation is experienced The Spirft therefore not only openeth and applieth the promises to the heart but openeth the heart for the comfort of the promises and then pours consolalion into it He comforts the saints also by enabling them to trust that in the Lord Jesus they have righteousness and strength forgiveness of sins and title to eternal life as wiell as by renewing them after the image of the Son of Grod and so uniting their hearts to the holy will of God The original word in the New Testament which wfe have translated Comforter signifies likewise an Advocate One special way in which the Holy Spirit comforts believers is tlie exercise of his Advocacy or intercession in them The more they are enabled to pray in faith the more do they walk in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost The spiritual consolation which is given to believers is apart of eternal life Believing ye rejoice He that beheveth on the Son kath everlasting life One part of the fruit of the Spirit when he imparteth spiritual life to the soul iff joy Bat spiritual life in the souP eternal life begun When God who cannot lie promised before the world began eternal life to the second Adam for his spiritual seed he promised to him that upon condition of his bearing their griefs and carrying their sorrows they should become heirs of everlasting joy and heirs of himself as their exceeding joy As the saving knowledge Johtt xiv 16 Rom viii 26 Acts ix 31 iFetud John iii 36t Gal 2ii of Christ in this world is the earnest and beginning of the beatific vision of God and the Lamb in the heavenly world and as conformity to Christ in holiness here is the beginning of perfect conformity to him there so the consolation which the saints on some occasions feel in this valley of tears is the first fruits or beginning of that fulness of joy which will constitute part of their blessedness in that holy place on high The joy of the Holy Ghost which enters into them here is the same in kind as the joy of their Lord into which they will enter hereafter It is therefore by one apostle styled Everlasting consolation and by another Joy unspeakable and full of glory It is joy that is full of glory or glorious joy the very dawning of the day of glory Holy consolation is glory begun in the soul bud which will open in heaven and spread into inefiable and endless glory dawn which wiU shine more and more until the glorious San of righteousness brighten it into perfect and eternal day All the joy of the saints below is but as spark feeble spark compared to that blaze of rapture wluch will burn intensely in their spirits above It is but slight foretaste small drop of that immense ocean of uimiingled joy which they are to inherit in the mansions of glory Although they are not fai from the heavenly Canaim yet their hearts are often ready to faint under their sufierings from without and their conflicts with corruption from within but taste of the grapes of Eshcol the first fruits of heaven revives their Tbesa ii 16 Pel spirit rouses their zeal and quickens their dere of that endless rest which there remaineth for them Consolation keeps the holy soul upon the wing and increases her strength It is the very life of the soul When Naomi would express the comfort that Boaz should aiFord to Ruth she said to her He shall be unto thee restorer of thy life If the contentment and delight of the heart be taken away it dieth The souls of the wicked have an existence in hell yet because it is an existence without comfort their state is never said in Scripture to be state of life but on the contrary state of death Accordingly the irestoring of comfort to moumersj is called rviving of them The grounds and sources of holy consolation are especially the following God in Christ with all his glorious perfections as God of love grace and mercy and as the God and portion of the saints Christ in his glorious Person ighteousness fulness offices and relations or Christ living in tkem and living for them the Holy Spirit as inhabiting quickening sanc Cfying and sealing them and as the earnest of their eternal inheritance the covenant of grace as well ordered in all things and sure according to wliich Jehovah Father Son and Holy Ghost is their God and they are his peopie his peculiar people the infinite atone Ruth iv 15 IsaJvIi 15 Ps xliii Phil iii Isa Ixi 10 and xxxii 17 Gal ii 20 Rev 18 Cor 22 Blent the continual intercession the supreme do minion the inviolable faithfulness and the gracious presence of the Lord Jesus who is given for covenant of the people and the ordinances doctrines promises and ofiers of his gospel with the peremptory commandment given to sinners in common to believe on him these are the leading and the immediate grounds upon which the saints do by faith build their comfort and they are at the same time the sources from which by the exercise of faith they derive their consolation Besides these their faith and sense of the pardon of their sins of the acceptance of their persons as righteous of their adoptiofi of their sanctification and of the witnessing of the blessed Spirit are matter of consolation to them and so is the lively exercise of all the graces of the Holy Spirit especially of faith hope and love The comfort of justification because it is founded upon righteousness which is perfect and always the same is more stable and permasent than that of sanctification The great things which believers have in possession and the great er which they have in hope are the sustenance of their consolation The suitableness of those inestimable blessings to their hearts together with their sense of personal interest in them afibrdsthem unspeakable joy As to their experiences and evidences of grace these are strictly speaking not grounds upon which they build their comfort Iiom IJ Rom viii 34 Isa xli with Ps XIX John iii 23 Ixvi 11 Heb VI 18 Sam xiii Luke 47 Oul vi 14 TVWsIvI is sown for the upright in heart and though like seed sown in winter which lies long under the dod it seems to be lost yet it is preserved and it will in due season spring up to view and yield plentiful increase Though the seed of consola tion appointed for the saints may lie covered for time yet it is not destroyed Believers have at all times the seed or principle and also the habit of spiritual joy in their hearts Even in their deepest dejection they have seed of comfort that will spring up The fruit of the Spirit in them is Joy and peace and the Spirit as Comforter abideth with them for ever But although they always have the principle yet they have not at all times the sensible enjoyment of comfort They do not continuatiy exercise the grace of joy and therefore they do not always see or feel in themselves the principle and habit of that grace It is when they are exercising any grace of the Spirit that they commonly perdve it Tlieir sensible enjoyment of consolation in this life is often interrupted by the riMnaining corruptions of their nature by the fiery arl of the wicked one and by the hidings of Gods countenance from thcnu In interrupting their sensible comfort they themselves have sinftd hand Satan and his instruments have malicious hand and the Lord in order to manifest his sovereignty to chasten them for their sins to try and exercise their graces to excite their more earnest prayers and to teach them to improve for the future the sense of his favour Join xiv 16 Jer li 17 19 Isa Ixiii 10 Pet tath holy hand Hence though the teliever is sometimes lively and in his exercise of faith and love feels at his heart glow of heavenly joy yetat other times he is languid cold and in great degree disconsolate Like Hagar at the well his eyes are so held Aat he cannot perceive as formerly bis grounds of comfort and then his dsiy of gladness is turned into night heaviness The peculiar seasons in which actual and sensible comfort is commonly afforded to believers arcf the following The time of some special manifestatioH of re deeming love to the soul after dark night of desertion the season of Gods appearing remark ably for his church when some heavy trial is approaching in order to fortify their minds to endure it in and espedally after time of deep affliction the time of tribulation for the cause of Christ and his gospel often abodt the time of their first conversion the season in which the ordinances of the gospel are administered to than with uncommon Jiveliness frequently at the reason of much humiliation sorrow and melting Ps XXX Lam 15

These are for the most art the oidinary seasons of sensible comfort to the saiiits But as the Lord is infinitely sovereign wise and gracious in dispensing his blessings to them there are also some extraordinary seasons of rgoicing some ineffable glances of light upon their souls which penetrate transform and fill them with rapturous and inexpressible joy The comfort which the Lord bestoweth is in every instance the most suitable to the present necessity of the believer As thy days saith Moses so shall thy strength be The Chris Danix2123 Jcrxxxi1820 Cor xii79 llcv li 17 Gen xiii 15 16 and

seldom allows him mtich of the fatness of the earth and of rdheshment from above at once but when he cifaatteth befiDTe him all doors of help from thki world he openeth to him the doors of heaven It was only when the Martyr Stephensaw nothing but death for him in this world that he saw the lieavcns opened and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God When the Lord bringctli his people into outward straits he commonly favours them with inward enlargements when he jiuttcth cup of affliction into their hands he usually giveth them cup of consolation Will lie plead against me saith Job with his great power No but he would put strength in me The Lortl Jesus said to Paul when he was afflict cd by thorn in the flesh My strength is made perfect in weakness The time in which bollevers arc most sensible of their utter inability to resist and overcome their comiptions or temptations and arc most engaged in relying on their great Kcdeemer fir strength is the season in which by supporting tmd strengthening them He usually ttfForfs tlrcm the most illustrious displays of the perfection of his strength In proportion as their weakness apptars to them will his strength Atts ii 36 Job xxiii Cor xii appear perfect in comforting or strengthening jtheir souls under that weakness Accordhigly the apostle in another place saith As the sufferings xf Christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ The comfort afforded jto the saints is admirably fitted and proportioned to their sufferings in conformity to Christ and especialjy to their sufferings for him If the one aboundeth so does the other and that in the most Suitable and eKact proportion If gall be dropped into theircup suitable proportion of sweetness will also be infused so that their affliction wUl be in measure If they be under various troubles and trust in Christ he hath various comforts for them if they labour under powerful evils he hath strong consolations if under new afflictions he hath new comforts if under smaU grievances he hath small degrees of support to bestow if under great perplexities he hath great measures of consolation to impart if in deep distresses he hath deep comforts comforts that will sink to the very centre of the soul and if under continued trials whether external ch internal he hath continued yea everlasting consolations to giv them He will not suffer them to be tempted above that they are able but will with the temptation also make way to escape that they may be able to bear it He will either bring down the trial to their strength or bring up their strength to the trial If accordingly their holy consolation be at any time small it is because they are then not exposed as at other times either to outward tempta Cor Isa xxvii 8i Jl Cor 13 dons or to inward conflicts So long as believers are liable to yield to the prevalence of unbelief pride indolence an inordinate attachment to earthly things and legal temper the Lord is pleased to bestow or suspend to restore or increase spiri tiial consolation at such seasons and in such de grees as he sees most suitable to prevent or control those evils and to promote the increase of holiness in their souls Seeing true comfort is an inward strengthening of the soul agaiust trouble felt or feared it must as was hinted above be stronger than the trouble else the act of comforting will not follow If the comfort be not above the uneasiness it is no longer comfort No comforts therefore but such as are Divine can refresh the holy soul under trouble because in all other comforts the disease is above the remedy BeKevers should never be discouraged in the pros pect even of the highest degree of affliction for the spiritual comfort will be so adapted to the trouble as to rise above and prevail over it It is therefore better for them to have the consolation than to be exempted from the trouble and to want the consolation This is one special advantage of an afflicted condition to the saints that the Lord Jesus pities them most and com torts tiiem most in that condition It is commonly lien Satan or the world or the flesh is most bitter to them that he and his grace are most sweet Indeed his sharpest dispensations would often be his sweetest if they but knew better how to improve them 10 The spiritual comfort of the saints is accord zek xxxivi 16 Es xc 19 itg to their faiths According to

clear evidences of his vital union with Christ is duty but to take his comfort fresh om the fountain by the direct application and particular trust of faith is stitt greater duty duty by which he glorifies his faithful Redeemer more and receives an increase of pure and solid consolation Hence are these cheering passages of Scripture had fainted unless had believed to see thegood ness of the

should be much more delightful to him Unbelief and legal spirit wili dispose man always to look for something in him self as his ground of comfort but holy faith will have to do with none but Christ Nothing is such delight to the Lord Jesus because nothing honours him so much as direct and unsuspecting confidence in him for salvation Whereas look ingto him or looking upon bim through ones own

things of Christ the formallist delights most in hi own pretended interest in those things That which delights him is not so much the beauty of the Lord as the beauty of his own experience The delight which the believer taketh in the Xiord and in his word is his chief de light his exceeding joy The dearest delights of Joho Cor vi 10 Prov xiv 13 Eccleg yJL FbU Hi iv 6f and xixr 10 B5 S4 ypTKiruAL

his heart is melting for sin than he trould do though he hail all the carnal delights irr the world On the contrary the delusive joy of flio formalist will either in time or in eternity be matter of sorrow to him True comfort is hidden from unregenerate men It is as far out of the reach of worldly menv to discern the spiritual joy of saint asitis out of their power to prevent or to rnoT it The consolation of the sinoero Christimi is unspeakable and no wonder for the matter and tho importance of it are in comprehiDnsible but the greatest joy of the hypocrit and the worldling can esily be told it can without difUculty be expressed to the utmost of its value True consolation isgforKerf or orious joy it has the highest and most glorious objeot and it is the beginning as well as the earnest of glory in the soul cofmferit joy on the oou Matth 4k Isa Ivii 15 Jobii xvi 20 Mattb xlii cIvJer iv Prov xit IS tstwryyis base and iogloiriousv The consolfttioti of the believer is holt it

J0I111 iii ficm vii 22 24 Pf cxix i28 S6 SPIRiTUAL COMFORT the hypocrite to neglect that exercise In wordT True consolation is permanetit It is by the Holy Spirit so fixed in the heart that it can never be wholly removed and it is so strong that it swallows up almost aU matter of unwarrantable fear and grief Indeed when the believer hath lost aU sight of his personal interest in the Saviour he cannot as formerly exercise his joy God and cannot in such case but lose the sense of that joy even while the principle and habit of it still remain But though the hypocrites persuasion of his pretended interest in the Divine favour continues yet his joy ceases his sense of that interest becomes insipid to him 12 In proportion to the degree of holy consolation that is affcnded the believer his dttty is his de light Being renewed in thespirit of his mind the more clearly and spiritually he discerns the loveliness of God in Christ and the more cordially andfirmly he believes his love to him the more dotlr he love God and the more he loveth God the more he delighteth in Him In proportion also as he spiritually discerns the infinite amiableness of the holiness and the other perfections of God and believes with application his redeeming love he in the same proportion approves Him and the manifestations of his glory in the face of Jesu Christ but the more he approves or is pleased with God as gloriously manifested in Christ the more delight does he take in him Add to this that the more he is enabled to trust cordially that John iij 20 2L Jobn xvi 22 Job xx Jobai19 IN GENERAE Sf God in Christ loveth him and that He is not Ihis enemy but his Friend and his Father the more of spiritual comfort he will have and the more of that holy consolation he has which is rejoicing in the Lord the more will he delight in him as his own God and Father Now in proportion as the believer is enabled to love to be pleased mthf and to rejoice in God through the Lord Jesus Christ he is at the same time enabled to delight in the infinite holviess of God as his God in Christ and in all the iUustriou displays of it which especially in redemption are afforded him And because the moral law in the hand of the glorious Mediator is fair transcript of Gods holiness and declaration of his will the believer delighteth also in that law after the inward man He lovetli it because it is holy and just and he consents unto it that it is good In the same degree then in which holy man is delighted or comforted by spiritual discovery of the transcendent loveliness of Jehovah and by firm belief of his infinite love to him does he de Hgbt in his holy commandments but the more he delights in the commandments of the Lord the Hiore pleasure doth he take in iqiritual and uni Tersal obedience to them His heart is united to the will and to the glory of his redeeming Godr and the more he is refreshed by the hoiy consolations of the gospel or enabled to rejoice in Christ Jesus and his great salvation so much the more dotb he delight ia evangelical obedience to his wilH Ps cxxxviii Rom vii 22 Ps xix 7rlOjr Dd cjLix 97 Horn vii ISw SaSLVsu Mul in holy activity for his glory The more his heart is comforted the more wiJl it be comfort to him tomortily sIb ami to practise holiness the more unifonniy will he rejoice in all opportunities of doing good and the more ardentlyy will ha seize them Beholding the transcendent beauty the Lord and trusting that in Christ this God his God and tlmt he lovetlihim with aveverlasting love the believer delights to think and speak of Him to adore awl serve him and in alt things to resign himseh to his blessed wilL Anointed with the oil ef gladness and rofreshed with the sweetness of redeeming mercy he deBghts in imitation of his great Redeemer to do the will of God and accounts no pleasure under the sun equal to that of doinggood Could he be more holy and spidtuallv minded it would please him better than though he possessed all the riches honours and pleasure of this workl The ipore fib holy soul is invijorated with spiritual consolation the morer active and cheerful he is in all hisdufies for in proportion as be delights in them they are easy ta him Indeed holy living usually begins witli comfort and is maintained by it The methodof gice revealed by thegospel is to comfort oui7hearts and thereby to establish us kievery good word and work 13 Finally The Lord uua dispensctfi cofi sciationr aid affliction allotnatelif to lii people in ordbr that they may neither bo toe much depressed noF too much elated The apostle Paul informs Piov iii 17 Ps XXV 13 Matti xL 30 OS that lest he should be exalted above measurei through the abundance of the revelations whicb hady in aa extraordinary nnner been afforded him tkeFe was given to him thorn in theflesh messenger of Satan to buffet him In order that he might not through the canity and deceiti fulness of his heart be elated with an unbecoming conceit of himself as if he were better than other apostles because of the abundance of the revelafoons with which he badi been favoured the Lord employed means the most effectual to keep him humble He permitted Satan and his instrumentsj to afHict him either in his soul on body or perhaps in both and tliat in jntmneu very abasing and grievous to hrm But that the holy apostle might not bo too much cast down by this paiufui affliction the Redeemer in answer to his prayer comforted himwith this gracious promise My grace is sufficient for thee We read also thatv the Lord shewed Xkivid at one time great and sore troubles but enabled him to trust that he Would at another quicken him and comfort him on ety side Prophet personating the an eient church in her captivity says Thou hast lifted me up and easfc me down The believer then while he is in this world has cloudy and dear days tempestuous and calm seasons He is at one time in the valley of tears and at another onthe mountoin of joy His gifts his prosperity and in consequence of these his danger of carnal afecurity arc sometimes sotfeat that the Lord ii or xii Ver Ps li 20 Pa cii 10 order to prevent his being intoxicated seeth it ne cessary to mingle water with his wine He sees it may be that when the outward path of the Christian is smooth he is not in such case fil to be trusted with inward consolation except in small measure He therefore in his infinite wisdom and love varies his dispensations to the believer By wise interchange of adversiy and prosperity he sets trouble and comfort for the most part the one over against the other that the one may be foil to the other that the Christian may find chort an easy and safe passage between themf that in adversity he may weep as though he wept not and in prosierity rejoice as thoughhe rejoiced not Indeed so long as sin remaineth in the believer he must in order to grow in grace have distress and comfort either alternately or both together to the end that when he is sorrowful he may not be cast down too low and that whenhe is rejoicing he maynot be lifted up too high Are Christ and God in Christ together with his grace mercy and truth as hath been said above thepiimary grcuiids oi Si saints comfort and hope hence infer that hk manifold infirmities and deficiencies in his exercise of grace and performance of duty should ap no time discourage him Belie ver thy remaining darkneasj deadness carnality weakness and indisposition of spirit for holy exercises should indeed occasion in thy soul much godly sorrow and selfloathing but they should never discourage thee in thy holy endeavours nor cawsa thee to despond They should not make fJEccks vil CoTV thee distrust thy faithful Redeemer or doubt of any promised blessing because thy title to grace and glory is not founded on thy own performances but on the consummate righteousness of the Lord Jesus and thy exercise of hope should be suitable to Xhegrotmds of thy hope Be not disquieted then though thou feelest the corruption of thy nature strong and active while thou findest at the same time thy renewed nature striving in opposition to it and mourning under painful sense of it Unbelieving discouragement arising from sense either of sins or of wants of desertions or of temptations will weaken thy hands and indispose thy heart for spiritual obedience It was when Peter began to fear that he began to sink in the waten Doth the Lord Jesus usually afford inward and sensible comfort to his children about the time of their first conversion They may see in this an illustrious display of his manifold wisdom as well as of his redeeming love to them One thing that he designs by this is that they may perceive as early as possible the inexpressible advantages that they have gained by the gracious change which his Holy Spirit hath produced in them and thereby be encouraged as well as inclined so to run the race that is set before them as to attain the prize of inexpressible and endless joy in his immediate

proceeding under common providential ProT liu 11 Prov wy 10 influence from marfs natural constitution of body this is inward and holy and is eflfectfed by the Holy Spirit the Comforter dwelling in thesoul Spiritual consolation is sometimes sensible as well as that which is natural or rather the former might as it sometimes is be styled sensible consolation and the latter sensitive delight Spiritual comfort delights chiefly the rational and inward faculties of the soul natural comfort pleases only the outward and sensitive faculties of it namely the imagination the natural piritj and even the external senses The former wrought in the heart by the Holy Spirit according to the word spiritually understood and believed the latter is often produced by the external manner of the reader or preacher of the word such as his elocution tone and action Persons of soft natural constitution of body have this sensitive delight oftener and in greater measure than they of contrary temperament When the one is enjoyed by the saints they commonly can assign some reason for it when the other is felt by persons of any description they usually can give no reason for the delightful sensation but only that something they know not what has made pleasing impression upon them Spiritual comfort is the opposite of trouble of mind on spiritual accounts natural comfort is the opposite of melancholy which is bodily disease the former as already observed is the special work of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of sincere believers the latter proceeds from natural and external causes and it is pften raised by Satan in order to confirm smners in their delusion and hypocrisy Th hypocrites in Zion mentioned by Isaiah took delight in approaching to God and the hearers compared by our Lord to the stony ground immediately received the word with glailness Thus it appears that thousands of men and women whose unholy lives demonstrate them to be utter strangers to spiritual and holy consolation have nevertheless on some occasions much natural and sensible delight Let no man therefore ccmclude that he is true Christian merely because he has felt much sensible and even transporting joy for his joy may be nothing but natural sensation Once more Is holy consolation peaiJiar to holy persons Then it doth not belong to unholy men The same spiritual comfort tliat the saints have received is in the gospel offered freely to thee ivho livest in the love and practice of some known in and the authentic offer affords thee warrant to receive it but no warrant to receive it separate from Christ or otherwise than by receiving hinpi with his righteousness and salvation It indeed affords thee right to trust in the Lord Jesus for all his salvation and for holy consolation part of it but no right to trust that he will give thee comfort apart from salvation no warrant to trust that he will afford thee spiritual consolation in the love and practice of any iniquity Thou canst not rejoice for joy as

believers for the lively exercise of their graces and the spiritual peformance of their duties will appear if the following particulars be considered It istf such uns2cakable consequence to them Isa Iv 48 THE IMPORTANCE AN1 USEFULNESS that the eternal Father hath in the grtness of his love sen his only begotten Son into the world with commis3ion iopurchase it for them The Father according to his eternal covenant with the Son as last Adam nt him in order that he might bear iheir griefs ad carry their sorrows and so might at the infinite expense of his miparalleled anguish agony and death purchase for them the comfort which they in the first Adam had forfeited He sent his only his dear Son to endure the pains of eternal death for them that they might enjoy in union with Him the comfort of eternal life that they might enter into Zion with songs of triumph in their lips and with everlasting joy on their headfiU The Lord Jesus himself hath declared that the comforting of mourners in Zion was principal object of his mission into the world The Spirit of the Lord God saith he is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek He hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted 5to comfort all that mourn to give unto them that mourn in Zion beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness The Father hath also exalted him in the human nature to universal dominion on purpose that he might dispense the comfort of salvation to all who should believe in him Accordingly when he was about to leave the world the legacy which he left to his disciples wiis comfort He promised that their sorrow should be turned into joy and that in him they should have peace when in the world they Of SPlRlTUAt COlVlrORt 49

solemn charge to the ministers of his word Strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees Say to them that are of fearful heart Be strong fear not Dolmen set such high value upon earthly

Loiid let drop or two of lieayy comfort and aQ was turned unto sweetness the znconeeivable excellence theimiwralleledsweetness of Divine consolation The high inortance of spiritual comfort win also appear if we consider that it is the pujpe delight which saints have in common wrik holy an gels The pleasures of sense are such as bdlevers have in common with irrational creatures the pleasures merely of reason are such as they attala equally with oUiermen but the ddights of com munion with God are such as they enjoy in com mon with the anIs of light They are not indeed the same in degree as the joys of angels bat they are the same in kind They ae the plea sures of soul and not of bodily sense the de lights of holy soul and not of carnal mind Theipleasttres of true religion do immediately

is substantial and satisfying heavenly and glorious Their joy is in its own nature unspeakably glorious and is accompanied with glorying in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ It is truly honourable and is the earnest of glory in their souls Wlien sinners have come to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling they so cometo an innumerable company of angels as in some measure to pirticipate with them inthat sublime that celestial delight which they always enjoy in the presence cf God and the Lamb They then begin to imitate the holy und blessed angds in delighting in objects of the greatest worth and especially in the mil and the glof of God in Christ Spiritual consolation is of such consequence to 43elievers and to the glory of God in their salvation that every part of sacred Scripture contributes to promote ity and is intended to do so Whatsoever things were written aforetime says the apostle Paul were written for our learning that we Arpugh patience and comfort of the scriptures might liave hope as if he had said Whatever things were by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit written in the Old Testament were left on record not only for the ipstruction of our ancestors but for ours likewise in order that we by means of them might be excitednd encouraged to exercise patience dnder 11 our afflictions and might be partakers of the joy of faith and comfort of the Holy Spirit so as to attain the sure hope of grace to bear them and of glory to crown them AU the types and prophesies histories and examples laws and doctrines recorded in the Scriptures were designed to increase the consolation of believers under their various troubles Accordingly they all in the hand of the adorable Spirit serve ei ther directly or indirectly to advance their comfort For this end were the Old and New Testameats written that they might like breasts of consolation be sucked by the children of God The blessed wordis in all its parts magazine of comfort to the saints Even those parts of it which seem least adapted to afford them comfort do notwithstanding promote their consolation and their delight The strictest of its commands prescribe to them delightful work The severest of its threatenings deter them from wandering om of sncfa Ways as are ways of pleasantness iand path of peace The law as covenant is subservieiit to the gospel and both serve to bring the believing soul to holy comfort One commendation oi the statutes of God is that they rejoice the heari The holy word of God is in all its parts iiiexjiessibly sweet to the exercised Christian it is the jpy and rejoicing of his heart The most delicious honey is not so grateful to the palate as the holy Scriptures are to the spiritual taste How ntispeakably important and useful then must spiritual consution be when it is the great design Isa Ixvi 11 Ps cxix 140 Rom vii 12 Cor xly Ps xix Jer xv 16 Es xix 10 C3 54 THE IMPORTANCE ANI CSElLNESS efevaypart of sacred

the greatest earthly comfort that ever they enjoyed which was his bodily presence sorrow filled their hearts but he assured them that this loss would be expedient tw as the original word also signifies profitable for them in as much as it would make way for still greater mercy the coming of the Comforter to abide with them for ever Believers then may assure themselves that the allcompassionate Saviour will at no time and on no oceounft take away any of their comforts from them but with view to give them better comforts He will usually be sweetest to them when their lot in the world is bitterest for the sharper their trials are the more will they serve to prepare them for his sweetest consolations If even thick clouds intercept for season the cheering light of his countenance from them those very clouds will occasion this light to break forth again upon them with the brighter splendor Whether their trou bles be external or internal they in the hand of the Holy Spirit serve to shew them how much they need to trust constantly and solely in the Lord Jesus for sanctifying and supporting grace and the more they trust in Him the more comfort as well as holiness do they receive from his fulness Spiritual comfort is of much consequence to believers for it serves in very high degree to heighten and seeten all their temporal comforts It renders every outward

the almighty Jehovah is an infinite enemy to him that his temporal comforts may be followed by endless torments and that by all that he cateth and drinketh he may be but fattening for the day of

peace of conscience makes even the meanest morsel sweet It infusetb an additional sweetness into every other comfort When man is enabled cordially to trust thatj the Lord Jesus laveth and saveth him and that he will perfect that which concerneth him his joy and peace in believing cannot fail to impart heavenly sweetness to all his earthly joys By trusting in the blessed Redeemer he tastes that he

Thus we see that spiritual consolation is of importance because while it is in itseU the gr eateU of aQ comforts it is that which serves to htcn all other deligfats This comfint is of unspeakable

comforted they can rejoice and even glory in tribulation This is plain evidence of the high importance and excellence of spiritual consolation that it overcomes the pains of sense takes out their sting and takes off their terror Holy comfort makes believers to defight so in all the will of God as to take pleasure even in the hardest things considered as his doing How sweet then must that be which can sweeten even the wormwood and the gall Of what consequence must that be which can make the heaviest burthen light Tlie delights of sense forsake ud when we are in trouble and liave the greatest need of them but it is tAai that the comforts of the Spirit have the sweetest relish and the strongest influence They are like the tree cast into the Waters of Marah which made them sweet How much then are they to be pitied who are drinking deep of the bitter waters of affliction and have nothing of Divine conola to sweeten them It is qiritual consolation onI which can effectuaffy remove

spiritual consolation eieciaUy when it is strong not only alleviates but effectually removes that nost intolerable of all afflictions When after dark night of desertion the Lord graciously returneth to the disconsolate believer and lifteth up the light of his countenance upon him He thereby puts gladness in his heart far sorpassing that of worldly men when their corn and their wine increase By so doing he putteth off the sackcloth of tlie exercised Christian and girdeth him with gladness No sooner doth Christ comfort tliem who mourn in Zion than he giveth unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the gjpient of praise for the spirit of heaviness If they have gone forth and wept bearing precious seed yet no sooner doth He impart consolation to them than they cqme again with rejoicing bringing their sheaves with them In his favour is life weeping may endure for night but Joy or shouting cometh in the morning How valuable then how unspeak ably important must Divine consolation be to exercised Christians when they consider that it is the onty the sovereign cure for dejection and anguish of spirit The great importance of spiritUar comfort Trov XXV 20 Ps iv Ps xxx 11 THE IMPORTAyCE AND USEFULNESS also appears in this tliat it serves to twerbalancr ievery tiling in true religion which seenis drfflctdt and unpleasing Not regnrding here either the misrepresentations of some men or the misappre hensions of others concerning the way of holiness shall only advert to the rAfdifficulties and giieVances which the Scripture itself represents as occufing in that way The Lord Jesus that faithful and true witness informs us that the way to heaven is narrow way or as the words might be rendered strait or disiiressful way way in which the saints have to passthrough much tribulation into tKe kingdom of God Beside the multitude of imaginary difficulties which appears to the slothful man when he says There is lion in the way lion is in the streets diere are some real difficulties in the way to the heavenly felicity Believcis as well as other men are commanded to exercispentance daily and so to weep and mourn and loath themselves for their iniquities to crucify the flesh and so to mortify the members of the body of sin in them which is as painful as the cutting off of right hand or the plucking out of right eye to deny themselves to renounce the world as portion and so to abandon for ever all the pleasures of sin to take up their cross and to lay their account with manifold afflictions and at the same time to fight the good fight of faith to wrestle against the principalities and powers of darkness to endure hardness to run with patience the race that is set be Matth vil 14 Acts xiv 22 fere them and to be fervent in spirit serving the Lord Now though these and others whichr might be mentioaed are in themselves real diflScultie which seem very unpleasant and from which even eminent believers are often ready to shrink yet holy comfort is more mnch more than sufficient to overbalance thein It serves in the hand of the blessed Spirit to render wisdoms ways notwithstanding all the difficulties and grievances which occur in them ways of pleasantness and paths of peace to the saints Nay so sweet and so powerful is spiritual consolation that in proportion to the degree in which it is bestowed it makes even those painful exercises themselves pleasant those difficult duties easy It renders it very pleasant to the Christian to be without the pleasures of sin It adds much more to the pleasantness of holy life than it is possible for any sufferings or grievances in this worlds er to take from it The sufferings are but human the comfort is Divine Believers know by experience that in proportion as they trust in Christ the times of their greatest affliction are usually the seasons of their strongest consolation and therefore even the most dejected and sorrowfill of them would not for thousand worids change conditions or pleasures with the most prosperous of those who are the servants of sin 10 Holy consolation removes in proportion to the degree of it the terror of death andjndgmenL Spiritual

grace it is still the enemy of nature dislike and fear of death therefore do nowise prove that one is not true believer We are not in general fond of handling serpent even though we know that its sting is plucked out But when the faith of Christian is strongs and his hope of salvation lively the joy of his faith and the rejoicing of his hope take away in his view the fnghttul appearance of death and bestow upon it an amiable an inviting aspect Living comfortsin his dying moments mke him even desire to depart and to be with Ghrist the blessed fountain of everlasting consolation It is the joyful hope of blessed resurrection that makes the saints think without fear of resigning their bodies to the gloomy grave It is the cheering prospject of an Souse not made with hands that makes them will ing without dismay to leave their earthly tabernacle When the Lord Jesus would comfort his disciples in the prospect of Jis departure from them he said go to prepare place for you and if go and prepare place for you will come agairif and receive you to myself that where am there ye may be also If death were to come aloney to the saints its ghastly coun tenance could not but be tenible to them but when they believe and rejoice in the assurance that their living Redeemer will accordingto his faithful promise come along with it to sweeten it to them and to conduct them safely through the dark valley of the shadow of it to the heavenly mountain of their Fathers house the prospect is no longer dreadful but delightful How consoling are these words of the great Redeemer He doth not say that comfort merely will come in that time of need but that He himselj the glorious fountain of consolation will then come and receive them to himself It is the comfort of such promise when believed with application that relieves them against the dread of endless torment and so raises them above the slavish fear of dying When the 9postle Paul says that Jesus died he speaking at the same time of believers says that they only deepy and sleep in Him One reason why he varies the term is this Jesus endured death in all its terrors in order that it might become quiet and sweet deep to them who believe in him It is Christ that died The suffering of death was bitter to Christ that the sleep of death might be sweet to them When they then are enabled to rejoice in the wellgrounded hope that death to them will only be dissolution departure falling asleep in the arms of their dear Redeemer the dreads of it is thereby removed People in general are not afraid toljfczdown in bed to sleep Ah oyf contemptible is that pleasure which is damped at the view of death and chased away at the project of judgment But how important how excellent that joy which instead of being itself abated lessens and even removes the terror of that last enemy 11 The high importance and excellence of it will further appear if it be compared with tfie de lights of sense Earthly and sensual joy is easily ThesB iV

The soul in order to be kept from lusting after earthly and carnal pleasures must by an appropriating faith take pleasure in the Savl our and in his love Holy comfort imbitters sin to man and djsposes him with deep abhorrence of it to strive against it It tends greatly to melt and to humble the heart for sin The firmer holy mans comfort is the softer his heart is The more his heart is fixed trusting ip the Lord so as not to be afraid of evil tidings the more disposed he is to fear the evil of sinning against him Spiritual comfort also inclines and encourages the saints ardently to follow after universal holiness of life and constantly to long for the perfection of it The Spirit of the Lord God saith Messiah is upon me because the Lord hath anointed mcjto comfort all that mourn to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called Trfes of righ teousness

Isa Uti 13 communion with God in every duty It is employed by the Holy Spirit to render them active resolute and checrlul in the spiritual performance rf all their various duties Godly sorrow indeed disposes them to be serious but it is holy joy that renders them active it is the oil 6f glftciliess that makes the wheels of their voluntary obedience move forward with ease and speed Some measure of holy comfort is necessary to the practice of evangelical holiness Summer in the natural world is necessary as well as winter The very nature of the duties and exercises of the true Christian is such that they require comfort of heart for the acceptable performance of them holy life commonly begins with comfort and is maintained by it The way to be kept frotn carelessness and formality in spiritual exercises is so to trust in Christ for salvation as to cease to despond for the soul grows careless by desponding The sorrow of the world and the fear of hell eriervate and benumb all the faculties of the soul man can perform no spiritual obedience without some degree of spiritual joy as well as of true love The former is as much the fruit of the Spirit as the latter The Christian

countenance shinic upon the Boul is better than life and all its most valued enjoyments If an Israelite was to be out off from his people who had in his house perfume like that of the Tabernacle surely the Lord will not hold him guiltless who persuades himself that any other perfume can be so fragrant so delightful as that of the house of God that any other joy cn be so excellent so ennobling

Hath he not done and suffered enough to shew thee that he is willing to enrich thee with consolation that he careth for thy ccmifort and that he giveth thee sufficient cause to be always of good comfort Were it not that there is something in thy heart which requires the discipline of his covenant he taketh such pleasure in comforting thee that thou couldst at no time be disconsolate Thou art therefore infinitely bound to love Him ardently and supremely to glory in his cross and to delight in doing his will From what has been said we may also learn that In proportion as man makes Christ and holiness his choice he will find them to be his de light The more communion with Jesus Christ and the more conformity to Him he desires and attains the more delight in him and in God through him shall he experience The more his heart is set upon growing in holiness and the more willingly and resolutely he performs all his duties Tor the glory of his God and Redeemer the more shall he know by elperience ttiat the ipotnforts of religion overbalance ttie difficulties of it In proportion as he takes pleasure in spiritual exercises And holy performances and that from love to Christ and for the glory of God the most labori 6us exercises of religion shall become pleasant to him and the most dMicuIt duties easy Holy consolation inthe hand of the blessed Spirit makes oery thing in holinessj pleasure to him and the closer Jhe walketh with God the God of all comfort the stronger and sweeter is hisxonsolation If spiritual comfort is of such importance and utility to believers as hath been shewn surely is the duty of every believer to use diligentlj the appointed means of attaining giadual increase of it The apostle Paul exhorted the believers in Corinth to be of good comfort that is to be so dirrent in receiving by the frequenl exercise of faith the conrfort offered and promised to them in the gospel as to attain more and more of the joy of faith and of good conscience Nothing will carry Christian tlirough the inward and outward difficulties of religion but the inward supports and delights of it Every believer theiefore should constantly endeavour to attiain as early as possible mitch of the comfort of the Holy Spirit that he may the more easily and Aeerfullv surmount every difficulty and be the more resolute in the practice of universal holiness The hypocrite will not always

to them Die loss indeed of lively and plea sant feelings though grievous yet is not usually very great loss to the exercised Christian but the loss of that ardinaiy comfort or tranquillity of mind which he has hitherto enjoyed is both very great and very grievous loss to him He may for season be without sensible and lively impressions and yet not be deserted of God in respect of habitual

And though the sins of some particular believers as in the case of Jobj may not in cfvery instance be the procuring cause of their loss of comfort yet they are at least the occasion of it Ail that in this Chapter further propose to do is to point out some of the leading sins and ways of sinning by which believers provoke their lieavenly Father to suspend for time that degree of holy consolation from them which they have formerly enjoyed In the first place They provoke him to do tlift by allowing themselves to continue iu culpable degree ignorant of his covenant of grace and of their warrant to come as sinners and to trust in the Lord Jesus for their own particular salvation These are objects in which the comfort of true be lievers is at all times intimately concerned the spiritual and distinct knowledge of which is necessary to qualify them for deriving continual supplies of grace and consolation from the fulness of Christ If believers then suffer themselves surrounded as they are by the clear light of the blessed gospel to retain ignorance or to cherish mistakes respect ing the covenant of JehoyMs peace and the in finite fulness and freeness of hisrac treasured up in Christ

sense in the place of his true and holy word Build thy faith and thy comfort upon Christ in the word and not upon thy experiences Do not live upon Christ as Jelt in the heart but upon Christ as fjffired in the gosp They procure for themselves the loss of spi aritual comfort by discontent and impatiencej arising from the inordinate love of some earthly comfortWhen good man instead of placing all his hap piness and all his hope in Christ and in God as his God and portion places much of them in ome external comfort so as to be disposed often to say What would become of me or How iMicomfortable should be were it not for this comfort he thereby provokes the Lord who is always more ready to projBt than to please his children to tear the idol from his embrace If he begins to make gold his hope and to say to ihe fine gold Thou art my confidence or if he trijsteth in man and maketh flesh his arm so that his heart departeth from the Lord he shall under the chastening of his heavenly Father be for season like the heath in the desert and shall ipt ee when good cometh but shall inhabit the zek xxxvj 25 Jcb xxxi 24 pckeil places in the wilderness in salt land and not inhabited The broken reed on which he leanetli will not only fail him but will go into his hand and pierce it His comforts will be diminished his hopes will be disappointed his schemes will one after another be frustrated His idol whatever itbe will either be torn from him or be turned into source of daily vexation to him The Lord will break his cisterns and send worm to his gourds For the iniquity of his covetousnes saith Jehovah was wroth and smote him hid me and was wroth and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart The inordinate and immoderate love of any temporal benefit doth upon the loss of that benefit commonly pro duoe discontent impatience and fretfulness which have natural tendency to wear down the spirit Were the Christian to bear his loss of outward comforts in the exercise of faith and of resignation to the holy will of God he should still continue to experience inward consolation But when he pre sumes to fret and murmur as if the Lord had wronged him or had been unkind to him saying Alas My afflictions are very uncommon are peculiarly severe he thereby procures for himself in addition to his outward losses the loss of inward consolation Such behaviour as this forms combination of various sins all of which are inconceivably heinous and exceeding sinful Dis content inclines man to be impatient under afflictions discontent and impatience set his mind on the rack and torment it with distracting Jer xvii Isa Ivii 17 ences of the Holy Spirit it will be secured against the frequent incursion of multitude of vainthoughts which otherwise will consume much of his precious time defile his conscience and expose him sooner or later to multitude ofperplexing solicitous and sorrowful thoughts Nothing but the frequent exercise of trUe faith and repentance will commonly prevent in such cases his sin from being inscribed in legible characters on his chastise ment His vain thoughts if entertained will procure for him perplexing and uncomfortable thoughts David experienced much perplexity of conscience in consequence of his vain thoughts and prayed earnestly that the Lord would cleanse him from secret faults The Christian if he would retain his holy comfort must keep his heart with all diligence he must watch his thoughts strictly and constantly as well as his words and actions it will be necessary that be walk circumspectly In secret as well as in public If he suffer himself to indulge empty and proud tiioughts he will grieve the Holy Spirit of God and provoke Him to withhold influences of conso lation from his soul Believer if thou woukist keep up the comfort ofcommunion with holj God trust in the Lord Jesus at all times for sane tifying grace to enable thee daily to mortify the members of the body of sin in thy heart Suffer not thy thoughts to wander in prayer or in any other act of devotion When thou art about te pray consider on the one hand the greatness and Ps xclv 19 Pfi XIX 12 Prov iv SI3 Tariety of thy wants and on the other the omniscience and holiness of Jehovah to whom thou art to send up thy supplications who hath said that he will be sanctified in them that come nigb him Guard especially in secret prayer against coldness and indifference If vam thoughts intruding in acts of Divine worship be not entertained but on the contrary be hated resisted and lamented by thee they will seldom be permitted to rob thee of thy spiritual comfort But if thou love them or yield to them or suffer them quietly to lodge within thee they will soon occasion sudv mist of darkness in thy soul that thou shalt not be able to discern the graces which dwell there Believers procure for themselves the loss of lioly comfort mistaking blasphemous and other fevil thoughts injected by Satan Jir sins of their fwn Satan sometimes in way of furious assault throws in suddenly and swiftly upon the souls of many of the saints temptations to blasphemous atheistical impure revengeful and despairing thoughts Such horrible injections are by the apostle Paul termed thejlery darts of the wicked one because like the sharp and envenomed darts of cruel enemy flying swiftly and invisibly they penetrate the soul before it is aware and hurry it on to hard and blasphemous thoughts of God and of the Saviour These violent and sudden temptations like impoisoned darts pierce and inflame the holy soul with anguish and horror and they not only fill it with the greatest uneasiness but if thejr for moment be yielded to they produce Ejh vL 14 the most imbeeomiog suspicions oi the gvace and the word of God BliispheiBous and

ought then not to charge them vspoa themselves as their sins but upon Saltan aft his Now it is because belleveri do not theji Qughty distinguish between those blasphemous and evil thoughts which are injected by the devil and those which pioeeed from their own hearts thatt they are often so imposed on by Saltan as ta mis take the former for of their own and so to dieprived of the consolation which

comfort hf not observing cautiously and constantly the motions of sin hU heart When he doth not accustn binise strictly to watrh these in order to cktect resist and mortify them as early as they begin to appear they will seediiy acquire such force as will urge him on violently and irresistably to thoughts words and acts of sin If he would retain comfortable fellowship with an iiimtely holy God he must watch diligently the first motions and sallies of deprAvity in his heart in order that James iv Ps xxviii Bom vliL 13 g2 HOW BELIEVERS LOSE by the Kvely exercise of the contrary graces he may resist them without delay for if be do not in such case instantly try to exercise his graces and eecialiy his faith Satan who is always envious and watchful will seize tliat opportunity to exercise his corruptions and if by being negligentto watch and resist the first motions of corruption in his heart he suffer them often to obtain suchforce as to gain the consent of his will to actual transgression he can have none to blame but him self for the loss of his holy consolation Seeing the remaining depravity of the heart ia not only itself source of temptation to actual sin but is the inlet for all temptations from Satan and the world the believer if he would retain spiritual consolation must Ukewise be ever upon his guard against temptations from wUhoiut If he ceae for short while to watch against thosetemptations of Satan which that deceitftd adversary manages in way of subtilty and stratagem he will soon be so insnared by one or more of them as to fair into sin Alas Spiritual wickednesses in high places which are every moment watching for opportunities to insniire his soul are so many and so powerful and so subtile that it is in vain for the exercised Christian to hope that he shll be able to retain liis comfort if he cease but for moment to watch Though he cannot shut Satan wholly out of his imagination he should however be very cautious that he do not even in the smallest measure provide fuel for his flame Jer 11 19 James 14 Jer xvii Eph vi 12 He should for this purpose often prayin faith sthat the Lord would so set watch upon his eyes and his ears as to enable him constantly to reject and repel every appearance of temptation to sin And if he would not be tempted by the men of the world who are also the inveterate enemies of his comfort he must always keep himself at due distance from them Christian the snares of Sa tan and of his emissaries are continually set for thee Be sober therefore and vigilant Watch thou in all things and watch unto prayer and supplication in the Spirit with all per Severance If thou wouldst retain thy comfort fhake off carnal security and take good heed lest thy spiritual enemies surprise and overcome thee Be continually solicitous to espy temptations while they are yet at distance in order to prevent them from surprising thee and that thou mayst be enabled to do so Be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might Trust that the Lord Jesus will and pray that he may strengthen thee with all might according to his glorious power by his Spirit in the inner man Believers likewise forfeit their spiritual oomXort by presuming without necessity to emit repeatedly some known didy When the Lord declareth in the Ixxxixth Psalm That he will visit thp transgression of the spiritual seed of Messiah with the rod and their iniquity with stripes the phrases by which he expresseth the sins or modes of sinning which would procure for them his pa Pet Tim iv Eph vl 18 Eph vi 10 Col 11 Eph iii 16 ternal chastisements are four and it is remarkable that he employs three of them to express the emission of uties and but one to express the direct commission of sins If his children forsahe ftiy law and walk not in my judgments if thejr breaks or profane my statutes and kmpfwtvuywL jnandments then will visit their transgression wkh the rod and their iniquity with stripes Though sins df commission do indeed expise Kevers to fatherly chastisements yet believe it witl be found that sins omissiim do it much more frequently because they are iaftener guiltjr of these and they yield to them with less struggte and remorse than they do to sins cif commission The spiritual declension of Christian especially at its beginning discovers itself for the most pari more by the customary omission of some duties than by the positive commission of crimes For although the omission of piiesent duty is indeed sin yet it doth not usualJy appear to declining Christian at first view to be so horrible as the direct commission of known transgression And therefore nothing commonly bnt some violent and strong temptation can at first impel him to the downright perpetration of crimen whereas very small temptation will often suffice to move him to the neglect of an ordinance or the omission of dnty If he should happen to be at any time fatigued more than usually or to be mider vtvy ilight bodily distemper or to have less time or less accommodation than usual or to be ditsturbed and ruffled in his temper or to be receivkig of Ps IxxKix 3032 Isa xliii 2224 injfing visits AcaQy one of these will

omission of known duty is sin against God the Qiristian by ailoiving himself ibr season often to neglect some known duty or not to perform it cbeerii fillly grieves the Holy Spirit of God and provokes Him to suspend consolation from his soul When he thus presumes to make the Spirit sad he must not expect that the Spirit will continue as formerly to make him glad The moment his heart withdraws and hangs ofl from any present duty as if it were an unpleasant or irksome task it does in the same proportion withdraw from the Lord and so it loses the comfort of serving Him as well as of conununion with him To resolve Fph vi Tim Col iii 23 James iv 17 Mai 13 14 John xiv 21 to omit present duty is even nfore sinfiil has actually to omit it without intending so to do Ah how heinous sin is it to be

slight and curtailed service Such behaviour il tiiis will soon very soon raise such thick add dark cloud as will intercept the cheering beams of the Sun of righteousness from the soul Alas the omission or slight performance of many duties is far from being considered and lamented by true Christians as it ought to be have already said that believer loses his comfort by omitting repeatedly and without necessity some known duty must now go further and add that If he live for long timV HI the omission of some duty which he doth not yet kncm to be duty but which he might have known to have

complain so much of his unbelief nor to be so diligent and frequent in his fctings of foith as in times past and to beso fpnd of his attainments in holiness as to be less diligent than formerly in pressing toward perfecIpon he may assure himself that he shall thereby lose tlie comfort of communion with holy and jealous God If he accustom himself for season not only so to rest in his religious

faith and evangelical obediHce But if he on the contrary idlow himself to be elated with his attainments or comforts and like Hzekiah invite others to see his treasures then it will be time for the Lord to send the messengers of his anger to carry away from his view these idols which steal away his heart from Htm When his heart is swelling with selfimportance and selfconfidence all that is then

exercise qfgracet cmd performance of duties We read in the Song Solomon that the Church lost the comfort of gracious visit from Christ by het sluggishr ness which disposed her to neglect entertaining Him so kindly as dhe ought and as the kindness of his mimifestation of himseir required When any of the saints have by joy and peace in believing and by rgoicing in hope found that in keeping his commandments there is great reward and yet afterwards become slothfid in the service Christ counting his yoke uneasy and hts burden heavy shall he not visit for these things They need not wonder that they lose their sense of his favour wheA they are con tscious that they otijen pray for his grace as if they prayed not when by iheir criminal indiflfer ence and the coldness of theii petitions they shew that they do not cas mudi whether these bcr Ps xvi4 Cor Pet Song 26 100 HOW BLtEVERS XOSE granted or riot Were tlley duly concerned dit the welfare of their souls they would frequently jefresh them by exercising holy meditation and iaith as they do their bodies by receiving food thrice or oftener in the day Diligence in holy exercises and moral duties is not only debt to the Lord but privilege to believers themselves and therefore by being slothful they discover at once injustice and unkindness contempt of the llIorieus Majesty of heaven and neglect of his redeeming mercy When the Saviour draweth near and they regard it not when He knocketh and they open not it is indeed high time that by withholding tlie comfort of his gracious visits from them he should chastise their negligence and rouse them to diligence It is equitable as well reasonable that the consequence of spiritual sloth should be loss of sensible consolation Accordingly in the administration of the covenant of grace an intimate connection is established between diligence in holy duties andthe fruition of spiritsal comforts The indolt Christian cannot retain tranquillity of mind What heavenly consolation must he lose for instance by his crimin al inattention to the precious promises of God and ven to the daily dispensations of his holy provi ence to him If his love which was once an ascending flame become feeble spark if his penitential sorrow whijCb once like Jordan over owed all its banks become like brook in smnttier if his zeal which formerly did eat him upt be devoured by leanness or declension if he who in times past could not give sleep to his eyes nor slumber to his eyelids tiJl Jesus gave rest to his soul can lie down securely with contracted guilt in his conscience and if he who formerly was diligent in spiritual exercise and holy obedi ence become remiss and regardless he thereby makes wide breach for the entrance of spiritual trouble It is indeed mercifully as well as wisely appointed that when he becomes indolent his comfort should decline in order that he may perceive in time that he is in languishing condi tion and may without delay entreat the Lord Jesus to restore his soul Besides if the Lord didnot on such occasions withdraw himself the Christian would not prize his gracious presence jly nor think it so comfortable as it is Be Iiever be not then slothful in business but be fer vent in spirit serving the Lord See that by grace received daily from the fulness of Christ thjr soul be vigorous and active in his holy service Be always diluent in attempting the exercise of grace in using the means of grace and in doing every good work in the strength of promised grace If persons linger on journey they are sometimes benighted if thou become slothful in exercising thy gracfes or in performing thy duties wonder not if thou begin to walk in darkness Be continually on thy guard then against every appearanccjUf inward declension and especially against slothftilness in the exevn of direct confidence in Christ and of secret prayer Prov XIX 15 lloi 15 Eom xii 11 iclcs ix 10 lOJ HOW BELIEVERS LOSE 11 Believers sutler diminution of their spiritual forolbrt by having and entertaining law estima Hon of the counsels and comforts of the Holy Spirit rf Christ When they allow themselves for season to entertain light esteem of the counsels or ordinances or promises or influences or comforts of the blessed Spirit when they receive these but not gratefully or keep them but not diUgently ey thereby dishonour and grieve the Holy Spirit himself who is the glorious Author of them An earthly Sovereign would account himself dishonoured if his proclamations or pardons or favours ould not be entertained with high regard eiqecially by those who are not only the subjects of his dominion but the objects of his favour In like manner if they who are the subjecis of the Spirits gracious influences and the objects of his peculiar liivour do not account his word their treasure his promises their joy his Sabbatlis their delight and his consolations their felicity they so far treat Himself with indignity and the more exalted glorious the adorable Spirit is the more sinful the indignity is which is thereby offered him Be sides if in their practical judgment they prefer mean and even sinful objects before the great things of the Spirit such as the wisdom and the maxims of the world before His counsels the comforts and the pleasures of the world before His consolations the riches and the honours of the world before the honour of holy conformity to Him and of intimate communion with him they do thereby offer an infinite affront to his glorious Majesty For what greater dishonour can tliey reject upon the holy and blessed Spirit than prac ticidlj to shew greater regard to creature to arata creature yea to an enemy than to Him Ah when Christians desire to the food of hift soul is almost gone when he appears as if he ha4 been surfeited with the gospel when Divine ordinances instead of being highly esteemed are basely slighted by him and when his heart is more set upon his farm or merchandise than upon iseasons of communion with God in Christ he Baust not be surprised if he should for season be taught the worth of these inestimable blessings by the want of them Or when by poring constantly upon the sins of his heart and of his life nd by setting the demerit of these as it were in battlearray against the merit of the great 4eeiiier8 consummate righteousness he makes litde accoiuit of the offers and promises of the bless4jd gospel he must blame none but himself for bis loss of comfort Christian consider well tliese words of the apostle Paul To be spirifr wlly minded is life and2eace Endeavour

are not suUable to their condition and which it would not be consistent with the scheme of their salvation to grant them at present nor indeed at any time When they venture repeatedly to ask in prayer something which the Lord seeth to be improper for them and not necessary to subserve the wise purposes of his glory in their sanctification They ask and receive not because they ask amiss If for

rightly exercised under it and if they pray absolutely for certain measure of tlie good things of this lifethe Lord will notand indeed cannot in mercy to them grant such petitions The consequence

Ps xxxvii and Ixxi 21 James iv John Lv 15 Cjor xii oTappoaring for their help and when the Lord be will surely do refuseth to come for their salvation in that particular way and at tliat very lime they take occasion from that refiiial to yield to disquietude and discouragement or when they venture to propose the Lords particular way of treating some other believers as the way in which they dcsiie that he would deal with them Mid find that tiicyare not gratified likewise in this they somctimesj begin to yield to discouraging and desponding thoughts Thus they presume to limit the holy One

only such petitions as are for tilings unnecessary and even hurtful to them that the LoihI refuseth to grants that he never denieth any of them without sufficient redscyn and that he sometimes condescends to shew them the reason that he never refuseth but when they ask what is not good or rather what is not best or them at the time referred to and that althougb they do not receive what they come for yet he allows them that which is sufiicient to bear their charges in coming and ging and invites them to come again They ought also to 4nsider that those arenotthe holiest nor the greatest of

the neglect of any known duty he sometimes presses him vehemently to rash and quick peribrmance of some difficult duty He suggests to him that the Lord is hard Master tliat he deligbteth in requiring difficult duties duties too which must be performed speedily and that on the pain of incurring his infinite displeasure that like tyjannical ruler who makes laws in order to ensnare hiis subjects he commands duties which are oppressive and doth it with unrelenting rigour and that he requires them to be done with the utmost degree of exactness or else he wiH not accept diem Now so far as good maa yidds to this horrible temptation he presumes to imagine dut the comttaddmenta of Ckd axe grievous that the yoke James iv Epli iii 20r Ghrist is hard Apprehending the Lord Jesug to be rigorous Master he under the prevalence of vish fear perforins even the easiest of his dur ties without courage without affection and even with aversion His comfort accordingly is destroy ed his heart is dgected his hands are weakened Moreover Satan sometimes urges him to at tempt the doing of several things at once which he well knows is impossible And the moment he yields to this temptation his heart begins to be so divided his thoughts to be so perplexed and hi3 attention to be so distracted between multiplicity of objects wliich crowd into his view that becomes incapable of performing any duty well Endeavouring to grasp too much he lets all slip Whatever he tries to perform he does it superfl ciaiHj and unseasonably When he is called to perform one duty he is perhaps addressing himself to another and like Martha he is careful and troubled about many things The great rule of every duty is this Whatsoever thy hand findth to do do it with thy might that is Let thy heart be wholly intent upon and occupied with that one duty while thou art performing it Indeed it cannot otherwise be performed either aoMptably or comfortably The tempter alio will sometimes instigate those 4f 4h saints who are called to peiform greater rariety of duties than others are to continue longmrtbaD is requisite in doing some one duty in mrder to put it out of their power rightly to dis jdiarge some otber equally incumbent on thenik lJdbnivi8 Luke 41 ccles ix KX He will press them for instance either to emplby so much time in the worship of the family and pecially in that of the closet as to have no op portunity for some other duty equally necessary or to spend so much time in some duty respecting their secular affairs as to have almost no oppor tunity for those holy and necessary exercises In propttkn as good man yields for time t6 this temptation it is easy to see that he thereby deprives liimself of that comfort of communion with holy God which is enjoyed only in conscientious and seasonable discharge of every knon duty Now in order to prevent hrs falling into this destructive snare he ought daily to trust as well as to pray that the Lord Jesus who is given for leader to the people would according to his promise guide him continually to that which in preference to every other is his present duty And when he discerns his present duty he should resolutely and in the faith of the promise dispatch that and then proceed in the same maniier to his next duty Let htm diligently perforna every act of obedience in its proper season and that he may have opportunity for every one let trim sa redeem his time as to spend no time in idleness or in doing any thing but that which his con science pronounces to be his present duty 14 Believers forfeit the continuance of their spi ritual comfort by the commission of gross and atrocious transgressions of such sins as are ifontrary not only to the light of Revelation but een io the light of nature By doing so they rbel Jm Iv Isa Iviii 11 Eph 13 ICi liiist and vex the Holy iSpirit so that he is turned as it were to be their enemy and to fight against them By such iniquities they at the same time wound and waste their own coti sciences When holy man presumes to resem ble the men of this world so much as to commit but one of the sins mentioned in Cor vi 10 or any other heinous iniquity he thereby pierces the Lord Jesus grieves the Holy Spirit inflicts de wound in his own conscience and so pro cures for himself the loss of holy consolation We see in some of the penitential Psalms of Da vid that his adultery and murder not only deprived him of sensible comfort but exioscd him and that for long season to Divine desertion in respect even of quickening and purifying influences We know also that leters denial of his blessed Lord rendered him for time very disconsolate If good man then instigated either by corruption within or by temptation from without suffer himself not only to contemplate with desire but ac tually to fall into any of those enormities which by one apostle are termed The works of the flesh and by another The pollutions of the world he exposes himself in an uncommon dree to the dreadful frowns of his heavenly Fa ther for such enormities as they are directly op posite even to the light of nature so they are most contrary to the influences of grace The sin of believer in falMng into any one of them is deeply Aggravated fmn all his manifold privileges and more especially from this that he usually has Isa Uiii 10 Gal 19ll Pet ii 20 an cril tfaio and bitter that they have fonaken fbe Lord tueir Got 16 Lastly Bdlever procare for tbeirtselvcs the loes of holy comfort by rchpsing often into the same sin Wht sin soerer it be and bow btrong soevw the temptation to it be the

proTalence of corruption and ihe power of teniptatioHi he sufi himself ti resemble so muc4i the secure hypocrite as to tike the smallest encouragement from the richos redeciiing grace in Christ to repeat the same offeree By Ins daring to do so he maketh Christ the minister of sin lie practically represents the holy Jesus and his great salvation as leaving him still under the dominion of sin yea as afiording him encouragement to practise iniquity Besides by relapsing often into the same transgression the Christian practically declares tliat he still loves and has Measure in that sin Now by loving tliat vdiich is inexpres sibly hateful and which the Lord hateth with ioifinite abhorrence and by counting that pleasant to his taste virhich is of all things the most bitter and which tendered to the Saviours lips the vino gar and gall the believer renders it indiqiensably necessary that the sweet and holy consolations of the lirit be suspendedfrom him in order that Jie may be mad to see that his iniquity is most batefui and to experience that it is most bitter PJenli 19 tCaiii Moreover the repetition of transgression heigh lens the crime As in figures the addition of one Sgure makes the number ten times greater so he Christians repetition of the same sin of sin jrhich he has often confessed lainented and revived against renders it heinous in tenfold decree and calls aloud for paternal chastisement such case he must be taught not only by he anguish of the Redeemers soul in the garden ind on the cross but by the trouble of his own pirit that sin is of all evils the greatest and that lis having fallen again and again into the same ifience after he had received the forgiveness sins renders his sin exceeding sinful And if after he has for Ihs disobedience been cha teoed with outward affliction he nevertheless turns again to the same offence this will if ininlte mercy prevent it not inevitably expose him inward distress which is inexpressibly more Ureadftil and intolerable Ah when man who lath believed through grace presumes to cast ropitious eye upop some easily besetting sin and jecretly to say Is it not little one and my loul shall live he is not aware how effectually he hereby robs his soul of holy comfort If after laving often complained to the Lord of his unbeicf pride selfconfidence deadness frowardness xjnsoriousness and other evils he still is ready almost every occasion to gratify if not to ex mse and vindicate them does he not hereby re remble the hjpocrite and is it not proper that he khould for season be deprived of the comfort of Ezra Lv 1314 Mai ii 13 seeing tbat he is sincere believer and also thiat Ke should be left under the prevalence of perplexing fears that he has hitherto been and at prent is but hypocrite do not say tbat mans relfq ing for time again and again into the same transgression proves him to be hypocrite for Ood hath nowhere promised such degree of strength to his people during their state of imperfecon will set them beyond the possibility of relapsing for season into the same offence but affirm that true Christians doing so makes himipear very like hjocrite obscures bis evidences of sincerity renders his condition inexpressibly dreadfiily and exposes him to very severe chastisement Believer if this be thy present condition apply and without delay plead this gracious promise will heal their backslidiig will love them freely and in the faitli of it watch and strive with holy resolution especially against the which doth so easily beset thee Know tbat tbj redeeming God hath made an unalterable an eternal separation between the love of sin and the joy of salvation endeavour diligently to become eminent especially in that grace which is more immediately the opposite of thy constituticHial sin Wouldst thou wish to keep down doubts and fears and to keep up faith and comfort Shun shun every occasion and every appearance especially of that sin Be persuaded that the pleasure of overcoming even the most easily besetting sin is inconceivably greater than the pleasure of commitr tuig it Frov XXIV 16 Hos xiv Tbess 22 From the foregoing particulars the disconsolate ieliever may plainly see that he has none to blame hii himself for his loss of holy consolation When he IB bewailing his want of peaceful tranquillity or of hojy joy he must complain none but himselE It is he himself that takes and even forcei way his own comfort for by his aggravated sins he bath rendered it necessary that the Lord should bide his face from him Indeed he never sins gainst God without sinning at the same time gainst his own souL We read in the Scriptures That we must forgive our enemies but never in express terms That we must forgive our Jriends The iniquities of Gods own people are the most provoking to him and though he hath forgiven tliem all as to the guilt of eternal wrath yet as the case of Moses he may refuse to forgive some of them in respect of the guilt of paternal anger The iniquity of others is marked before him but the sin of Judah is written with pen of iron and with the point of diamond The friends of Christ then must be ever on their guard against sin especially against wilful sin Sinning wilfully will assuredly weaken their hands and bring trouble into their consciences Does good man forfeit his holy comfort by making his graces or performances or lively frames his ground of right to trust in Jesus for salvation He should hence learn the need that he has to be daily exercising himself in moriifi ing the legal spirit which remains in him It is thiSf that prompts him to make his graces and dur Jer xvii ties his warrant to renew his actings of trust inr the Saviour and thereby to forfeit the comfort of his souL Next to unbelief itself his legal temper is perhaps the worst enemy of his pure consola tion It is secret and subtle foe that seems to intend him kindness whilst it is always putting him upon seeking for some good qualifications in himself on the ground of which he may trust that God loveth him and that Christ saveth him Let him therefore if he would retain spiritual comfort be diligent in mortifying his selfrighteous spirit and know that the way to conquer and destroy it is by faith to bring daily into his consci ence better hope from better righteousness than that of the law All the spiritual distress of the exercised Christian may be traced to legal spirit in him He seldom wants comfort but by looking less or more to his own nghteousness ia stead of looking off to the consummate righteousnefli of Jesus Christ Believer it is not sufficient in The Author of an excellent Sermon in pointing out some of the injuries which believers sustain bj the prevalence of the legal temper expresses himself thu It spoils them of their comfort and brings damp of sorrow and dejection over their spirits None have such ground of comfort as believers and did they know Jiow to improve thtir privilege did tlicy live daily la the faith of the gospel and in the comforts of theii nef state they would be the most cheerful peisons in the world but the pievalence of this temper like moth secretly worms out the very life of their comfoK and throws them into the depths of despondency Wliat comfort can they have in tiie duties of religion when tiey seek it from themselves ard from their duties What comfort can they have either in duty or out cf in the aiscnce of tlrciv God eider to maintain spiritual comfort that thou dost not rely on thy graces and performances for title to eternal life Thou must not presume to rely on them for even so much as right to trust in Chiist thou must not make them the smallest part of thy warrant to renew thy exercise of con fidence in him Again Do believers lose their holy consolation by living upon their comfort rather than upon the holy Comforter himself and by loving the former fts much as or more than the latter They may hence perceive that it is sinful and very displeasing to the Lord to rely upon the comfort already given them or lo love consolation in the streams more than or even as much as comfort in the fountain He taketh away sensible comfort from them because they have loved it inordinatelj or loved it loo much and because he would teach them efctually the necessity of loving the adorable Comforter Himself more than all the sweet consolation which they have received from him They must not expect that the God of all comfort will suffer them to let their love run waste upon their pleasant feelings He will elevate it all to It robs them of their peace As all true and solid peace is built upon justification bv the blood of Christ 60 it can only be maintained by the daily exercise of faith in this comfortable doctrine Being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Chiibt Horn But so far as the legal temper prevails their peace is set upon another foundation is built upon their enlargements in duty their frames and attaiumeDts in xeligion and therefore must be unitablo as water The Evangelical Preacher vol iii 10Q himself Because he loveth theni he will 60 cha9 ten them as to teach them to love himself sap remely and to live upon himself in the absence of Bisible delights He will teach them to love him more for that boundless ocean which is in himself than for the few drops which he had shed upon them more for his own infinite benignity than for the grace or comfort which he hath commanicated to them He will thereby at the same time shew them how weak their love of him is when they love him chiefly for the comfort which they have received from him and how weak their fikkh is when they live upon the streams rather than upon the overflowing fountain of ccoisolation Further Do believers by their aggravated offences provoke the Lord at any time so to bide his face from them as to leave them in the darl respecting the truth of grace in their hearts It follows that though grace is always in the heart of holy man yet he is not always able to disceni it there His heart is always the seat of the princi pies and habits of grace and yet he doth not coatinually enjoy the comfort of perceiving them The figures of sundial continue to be plainly marked upon it and yet we cannot see by it what hour of the day it is unless the sun shine upon it It is only wlieji graceaire in exercise and when the glorious Suaf righteousness shineth upon them that they can be seen Let not then any of the saints conclude that tliey never hftd and that they now have not wellgrounded assurance of their being in state of grace because doubts of the truth of grace in them do sometimes arise in their minds Their assurance of pefsonal interest in Christ is wellgrounded and true though it is far from being perfect Their graces themselves are imperfect and therefore that assurance of sense which arises from the perception of them must be imperfect likewise Such believers as resolve never to rejoice till they attain perfect annrftnce must resolve never to rejoice while they Mxe in this world They should consider that there iicf many degrees of real certainty below perfect kigree ci it and that they injure themselves much when they call their state of grace into qfwsttoti as often as they do not perceive clearly Kir habits cfgcce Once more Is it only by sinning against the iigh and holy One that believeis lose the comfort of eontmnnion with him They may hence discover what reason they have to abhor and with holy detestation to turn from all manner of siii Their iniquity has not only pierced the incarnate Redeemer and grieved the Holy Spirit but it pierces themselves through with many sorrows It is the worst enemy of their souls It incessantly strives to rob them of then purest and sweetest joys Let them therefore without ceasing strive against the motions and mortify the members of the body of sin that dwelleth in them If they allow even for moment sin to dwell at ease in them it will uredly deprive them of dieir holy tranquillity 130 COKSESUSXCES OF BELIEVER HAVING CHAPTER IV pT THE GMEVOUS GONSKQUESTCES OP THE CHRISTI ASS HAVING LOST HIS SPIKITUAI COHSOLATION X5t withhcdding spiritual

usually consequence of their having forfeited their spiritual comfort In tliat condition they are commonly in heaviness througli manifold temptations When the Lord is chastening any of his chiklren for being more ready to believe the lies of 3atan than the truths of His holy word he often permitteth that crafiy cruel enemy to hold them down and to terrify them And so far as he is permitted his constant LOST HIS SPIRITUAL CONSOLATION 141 work is to render them as uncomfortable in their way to heaven as possible Thus he treated Job llie spiritual trouble and the dismal terror of that holy man were for the most part from the immediate hand of Satan When this enemy of souls perceives that believers constantly resist his temptations to presumption he assaults them with furious and horrible temptations to despair And when he observes any of them under sense of Divine anger and dread of eternal wrath he oonunonly selects this as the fittest opportunity to enforce those temptations He then especially labours to persuade them that when God is afflicting them with such great severity it is sure evidence that he is not their God but their adversary and that they are not his people but his enemies He misrepresents both God and themselves to them and so insults them in their misery When that cowardly enemy perceives that their spirit is already broken down he makes his most furious assaults on tliem for he knows that when they are once cast down he can the more easily trample on and afflict them No sooner doth the Lord depart than Satan comes becomes to triumph over their anguish and to say Where now is your God Remember that your iniquities have been peculiarly great and aggravated and that ye have thereby provoked the Lord finally to abandon you ye do alieady feel his fiery indignation and you have reason good reason to dread that you shallendure it for ever He takes occasion from their anguish of spirit to represent the Lord to them as cruel tyrant as one who

knowing their weakness he with amazing dexterity and unwearied importunity urges against them eveft passages of Scripture and dispensations of provid ence in order to enforce his infernal suggestioM When he sees that their faith is very wik and that their sense of Divine displeasure is very deep he then shoots his fiery darts which penetrate and inflame their souk with additional angoish and horror It is pleasant sight to that wicked one to behold God afflicting his children and to see were it but one of them wounded with grieb broken with terrors made brother to dragonsand companion to owls He therefore afte they have been long disquieted and enfeebled by desponding fears assaults them furiously in ordev that when they are already pressed down he may throw upon them additional weight It is his usual method so to impress terror on their minds that it frequently comes upon them by sudden fits These fits or paroxysms commonly return whenever the troubled soul would pro mise itself some degree of ease Accordingly the usual time of refreshing the body with food and sleep are for ordinary the seasons which Satan watches for his renewed assaults He commonly injects at such times blasphemous and atheistical thoughts which fill them with horror and when he has thereby prepared their hearts he seizes the opportunity to persuade them that such Eph vi 16 Job XXX 29 Job iii 24 and vii 13 14 lOST HIS SPIRITUAL CONSOLATION 143 heart must be whc destitote of Tgeherhting grace And when he perceives that any of them re afflicted with mehmcholy he considers that distemper which affords him advantages peculiarly suited to his design the imaginatim is then disordered and so is fitter than at any other time to receive impressions from him It also fiirds him much advantage if they have lately iU en into some great and grievous sins especially one observes into sins against the third or sixth or sevairth commandment Arguing from sacli crimeSy he labours to persuade them that they are reprobated and doomed to eternal destruction When he perceives that they have been guilty of some atrocious iniquity he will suggest that It is even the unpardonable sin He argues likewise rom their perturbation of spirit that tlieir heart is so hardened by thedeceitfulness of sin as to be utterly incapable of exercising repentance unto life The more he distracts and amazes their minds with terrors the more unable they are to detect the fiillacy of his arguments and the more dispos ed tliey are to admit the force of thorn Excessive fear removes their souls to such distance from true comfort that they will not be persuaded to trust in the Lor4 Jesus either for his salvation or for the joy of that salvation Under such perplexing fears they seem disposed so far to

him For God maketh my heart soft and the Almighty troubleth me because was not cut off before the darkness Jealcms tiougits of Christy the glorioushad and husband of believing souls do likewise arise from the disconsolate heart If souls have hard thoaghts of God they will quickly entertain jealous thoughts of Christ Jesus And if they but begin to suspect that Christ doth not love them or that he is not faithful in peribrming his promises to them they will be afraid to take his word and afraid to trust him or to commit themselves and their salvation to him Christian be continually on thy guard against unbelieving and suspicious thoughts of the love of Christ to thy soul Trust firmly that he loveth thee and careth for thee and that he will never leave thee nor forsake thee Thy sensible comfort may leave theej but thy faithful Reileemer the husband of thy soul will never totally or finally forsake thee He may indeed for season cause grief but he will have compassion according to the inultitude of his mercies Say not then when he hideth his face from thee He hath utterly forsaken me but rather in the Job xxili 1417 Lam jii 32 exercise of unsnspecting confidence in him and in iris

faithful Redeemer Do not suspect hint without ground The moment thou art jealous of his love to thee thou sinnest against him with out cause The Lord Jesus at no time so conducts himself in his ways of grace and providence toward thee as to give thee the smallest cause to suspect his faithfulness And if thou wouldst never suspect his kindness and faithfulness to thy soul till thou had cause it is all that he would desire llemember that to be jealous of the holy Jesus is to sin not only against Him but agamst thyself Jealousy is the rage of mm and it is crudi or hard as the grave It will disquiet and torture thy soul it will waste thy spirits and prey upon thee like the grave Thou indeed hast been unfaithful very unfaithful to the Lord Jesus but this though ground of deep humilia lion yetis no ground at all for suspecting his faith fulness to his own promise upon which he hath caused thee to hope 12 Another consequence of their loss of spiritual consolation is their being usually so discomposed and dispirited thereby as to become at the tiniefi2r the spiiitiial pctfoimance qftlieir duty This will more especially be the case with tliem if as is too common they in their disconsolate con Mic vii 19 Lam ill 23 Piov 14 Song viii Fs cxix 49 dition forbear to tnnst in the Saviour for present and eternal salvation Though their obedience is not accepted on account of dieir faith yet it is spiritually good and acceptable in proportion to the strength and the frequency of their actings of ith If then they cease for season to act faith they in the same proportion cease for that time to perform spiritual and acceptable obedience to the Lord for without faith it is impossible to please him It is not sufficient in order to acceptable obedience that Christians have faith in principle and even in habit they must likewise have it in exercise and that even when they walk in darkness and have no light of sensible comfort But if in the darkness of spiritual trouble they forbear for season to trust in the Lord Jesus for complete salvation to themselves in particular that trouble will so disquiet and dispirit them as to disqualify them either for doing or for sufferings according to the will of God am saith Hemn as man that hath no strength Nay it hath made some of them even think that it is to no purpose for them to endeavour spiritually to perform any duty Indeed their souls when in tliat doleful condition are commonly so much occupied with the fear of eternal wrath that sin as sin and duty as duty are but little considered by them Moreover that conscience by which they judge themselves to be still under the guilt of all their sins is in the Scripture called an evil can science conscience which the blood of Christ Hb xl Is 110 Ps Ixxxvlii Eeb 2Z tOSTHlS SPIRITUAL CONSOLATION 149 ihustpurge from dead works in order to their be ing capacitated to serve the living God Love which is the fulfilling of the law and the end of the commandment must arise out of ooc conscience as well as out of pure heart That evil or guilty conscience by which disquieted Christians judge that the Lord is still their enemy because of their sins doth greatly strengthen the remaining enmity of their hearts against Him and so it indisposes them for affectionate and filial obedience to him For in proportion as they decline in their love to him they are hardly drawn to him in any spiritual service and easily drawn from him they come slowly and depart readily thcj approach with reluctance and while they stand before him it is with hesitation and dislike Besides as spiritual joy raises and invigorates the spirit so carnal and legal sorrow depress and enfeebles it All sorrow except godly sorrow lies like lead on the heart cold and heavy and presses it still downward It likewise makes the soul contract itself or shrink from that spiritual intercourse with God in Christ which it ought eagerly and incessantly to pursue Under the pressure of sadness especially when it is accompanied with terror believers themselves find no heart to pray and no life in praying They bow their knees they sigh and cry but the Lord secmeth not to regard them nor to return answers of peace to their prayers Their thoughts are for the most part in continual tumult and so iq all their efforts to pray wandering and perplex 150 CONSEQUENCES OF BELIEVERS HAVING ing thochtsr do sadly preTail against tbem Their sadness greatly abates their vigour of spirit and destroys their freedom of speech It dampeth also their faith and hope and love and so it mars their prayers as well as all their other spiritual jexercises Plnding that they are still as perplexed and as disconsolate after prayer as before it and fearing that their prayer is an abomination to the Lord they are almost at the point of giving it over They are troubled isrhen they do not pray and when they would pray they find that they cannot Sometimes when the trouble of their mind becomes eat and violent it suppres fies their words andean itself find no vent am so troubled says Asaph that canaot speak The waters of thehr trouble and anguish do so drown their cries that they either cannot pray at all or can find no liberty no plefw sure no relief in their prayers 13 Lastly The joint effect of those consequences above mentioned frequently is that the natu ral spirits begin to be disordered and dejected Trouble of mind especially when it is great or of long continuance commonly produces this dSect Such is the nature of the union between the soul and the body that there is almost never any vigorous exercise of any of the affections or passions of the soul without some corresponding effect thereby produced on the motion of the fluids and especial ly of the natural spirits of the body The motion pf the animal spirits is thereby altered whence often arises some bodily sensation especia aboal LOST HIS SPIRITUAL CONSOLATION 151 the hearty and other parts essential to life which are the fountains of those fluids So much is the body subjected to the soul and so much do the spirits of ihe body depend on the affections of the soul that the exercise of any one of the affections has direct tendency to produce some sensible efiect on the body and if the exercise of any one of them be great or violent it will produce an effect proportionably great and violent Accordingly the holy Psalmist expressing his vehement desire of communion with God in public ordinances says My soul thirsteth for thee my JlcsA longeth for thee And again My heart and my Jlesh cry out for the living God Now the affections of grief and fear do in proportion to the degree of their exercise contract the natural lipirits and render their motions feeble and slow The consequence is that the vigour of the body commonly declines its motions become sluggisli The lamp of life burns dimly The countenance grows dejected the complexion waxes pale and no liveliness nor activity seems remain Hence arc these complaints in Scripture On my eyelids is the shadow of death am become like dust and ashes My moisture is turned into the drought of summer There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger am become like bottle in the smoke My soul is full of troubles and my life draweth nigh unto the grave Ps Inii Ps Ixxxiv fi Job xvi 16 Job XXX 19 xxxii Ps xxxviii txiK 83 Ps Ixxxviii 132 coNSEiiirjEKcEs of kelievers having the motion of the spirits of the body is retarded and altered by the influence of the grief and fear of the soul so this alteration eicially if it coitiuue for considerable time will at length pro ilucc that disorder which is called melancholy Though melancholy which is indeed distemper of the body is totally distinct from trouble of mind strictly so called yet the former often proceeds from mid is increased by the latter and the latter again is reciproeally augmented and often prolonged by the former For as the soulcannot but feel with the body in its pain so the body cannot be exempted from sharing with thr Houly in its trouble Having now considered the leading consequences of the loss of spiritual comfort it will be proper to observe in order to prevent mistakes that in the case of some disconsolate Christians all these cense sequences concur but in that of others only som of them take place It is seldom except whea spiritual distress becomes very deep and continues long that they are all felt by one and the same bliever Spiritual trouble usually consists either in the loss of corafbrt together with all those consequences of it or in the want of comfort with some of them only and tliat ia greater or less degree Accordingly it is either total or partiaL Some believers have been afflicted with total difr trss of soul so that they have in certain dreei even despaired of mercy It possibly may to soroe appear harsh to charge so horrible sin as despaiiv upon true believers even in their deepest perturbft tlon ofspiriU But it sia xiOcitA to la LOST HIS SPIRITUAL CONSOLATION 153 that any of the saiiits ever fall into degree of despair it will surely be more harsh and uncharitable to affirm that none who ever do fall into despair are saints Indeed it cannot be denieti that some of the saints under the deepest anguish cf spirit have for time so despaired as to have been overwhelmed with terror in the dreadful prospect of eternal wrath Other believers again upon their loss of comfort arc afflicted only with partial trouble of mind and are soon delivered from it They have indeed painful experience of some or even of the most of those consequences above mentioned but not of all They have it may be painful sense of paternal anger but being enabled still to trust that the hand which afflictcth their souls is the hand of Father and not of an enemy they are exempted from an overwhelming sense of avenging wrath or tliey may perhaps have some feeling even of vindictive wrath and yet be under but very small degree of despondency Those of the saints who have even all those doleful consequences of their having forfeit ed their holy consolation may have them in greater or less dee and those who have only some of them may Ukewise have these in various degrees Trouble of mind in some believers is transient and short in others is fixed of long continuance and sometimes attended with very alarming symptoms But still however short and however low in degree it be the very lowest degree of it is inconceivably more intolerable and dreadful than the highest dree of bodily aJB9ictio2t Pfi

refuse to be comforted The troubled ttpirit of the Christian actually rises against releeniing grace It is well for him in such case that the covenant of grace in which he is still instated is well ordered in all things that it stands like wellmarshalled army on the fieW ready to resist liis attacks upon whatever part 6f it he may choose to fall Be deeply conviritced disquieted believer that thy refusing to trust in the Saviour aiid to be comforted is thy aggravated sin and that it is inexpressibly dangerous as well as sinful to allow despondenty and trouble to grow upon thy spirit Next The

Again It the duty of the disconsolate believer to hope that h6 shall in due time be delivered from his trouble It is good that he should lxth hope and quietly wait ibr the Salvation of tlie Lord for the Lord will not cast off for ever On these words of the Lord Jesus The very hairs of your head are all numbered Austin putsto believer this pertinent question Thou who canst not lose single hair how

to yield to eamal reasoning about the state of his soul for then he is least qualified to take Gods part against the cavils of Satan and of an evil heart of unbelief Were man in order to try and confirm the validity of his title to ah estate to encourage suit to commence against himself he surely would not choose for that purpose the time in which he could not find his evidences of that title Alas the time which good man chooses for giving ear to carnal reasoning is commonly the very tinve in which be hath lost hi evidences of grace And it is grievous to see with what weak piece of

anguish of his souL Atheistical and blasphemous thoughts do sometimes proceed from his own heart for our blessed Lord saith Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts blasphemies And he may charge liimself with such thoughts as having arisen from his own heart when instead of resisting them instantly and with abhorrenee he for little yields to them But if as is more frequently the case they come in suddenly and violently upon his mind if his heart trembles at them and with holy abhorrence instantly opposes them and if his being assaulted with them is very grievous to him he ought without hesitation to charge them upon Satan Mattb XV 19 Ps xxm xx2ik 21 2Z 158 ca75QUNCES OF BELIEVERs HAVING and not upon himself He should for his comfort never impute them to himself as his

that the believer under mental trouble is usually much disposed to read to remember and to apply to liimself such passages of Scripture and of human writings as ajre most adapted to increase the trouble and terror of his soul Such places of Scripture and of other books as are arousing and alarming are indeed very proper for good man often to read and remember hen he finds that carnal security is prevailing against him But when his soul is already dqressed with terror and dismavj so that he needs cordials to refrcsli his drooping spirit he ought chiefly and frequently to read meditate and believe with apjlication to himself such passages of Scripture as are most encouraging and consoling to his fainting soul especially these referred to at the bottom of this page Let him resolve firmly

enjoy tlie comforts and to perform the duties of life is nevertheless seated in the body But the state of body which accompanies this disease is acknowledged by the best Pbysicians to be in general beyond the reach of their investigation By this distemper the mind is so disordered that Jike an inflamed eye it becomes disqualified for discerning its objects clearly and jubtly Ihe disease is commonly attended with gloomy thoughts heaviness sorrow and fear without any apparent cause of them Wicked men are as liable to be afflicted with it as good men In the case of some melancholy though bodily distemper produces dejection of mind in that of others trouble of mind on spiritual accounts especially if it be great or of long continuance produces the disease of melancholy in the body Melancholy also increases trouble of mind and trouble of mind again increases melancholy where they both exist together they mutually increase and confirm each other How great soever beliexefs grief for and his dread of UvNm xit may be lie ought not to be called melanciioly so long as these appear to be rational and his imagination to be sound But on the other hand how small soever his measure of sadness and of fear may be yet if his imagination and mind be so distempered or impaired that he cannot assign proper reason for his sadness and fear nor express them in rational manner he is to be counted melancholy Now when good man is at any time afflicted witli this grievous distemper it will usually discover itself by more Or fewer of the folloing signs SCT OfiJie signs mdanclidy espeeicU kn tnse Christian holy man when he is under this monraful disease commonly gives himself up to excessiife grief he often wes without knowing why and thinks that he ought to do soj and if he bet appear to smile at any time or to taHc cheerfully Lis hesixi smites him for it as if he had done amiss He is usually exceedingly timorous or JuU groundless fears Almost every thing that he sees or hears of serves to increase his dread especially if fear as often is the case has been the primary cause ofhis melancholy If the distemper be not deep sadness and feir commonly seize him at intervals He is seized with fits of them for part of day or for whole day or even for several days together and after some short abatement of them they return upon him and he feels them again fastening on his spirit without knowing why Tlirough the distemper of his imaginatios he is disposed to aggravate his sin or misery or danger Of every common infirmity or fault he is ready to ipeak vfith horror as if it were an atrocious crime every ordinary affliction be considers as utterly destructive every small danger as great one every possible danger as proljble and every probable danger as certain He often thinks that his dy of grace is pasty and that now it is too late for hinty to believe to repent or to expect mercy Were any one to declare to him that redeeming grace is infinitely freeOr that the riclies of saving mercy in Christ jKte always overflowing or that the offers and calls of thegospel are directed to him inparticular he would still affirm that now it is too late because his day of grace is undoubtedly past No arguments will convince him that to conclude that liis day of graee is past or that God will never shew mercy nor give grace to him while yet God is continually beseeching him to accept his offers of grace and so to be reconciled to him is an unbelieving suspicion that the God of truth is not sincere in his offers and most sinful attempt to make Him liar The Christian dejected as he is ought seriously to consider how atrocious how reproachful how dreadful the sin of unbelief is He is perpetually apprehensive that he is uttet forsaken by God and is always prone to despair Like one who is forlorn and desolate his conti aual thought is that he is undone utterly undone Johav 10 Bat he certainly ought to consider that sintiers who are utterly forsaken of God are habitaally willing to continue in thehr sinful state and fram that they are lovers of sin haters of holiness andi so far as they have power and opportunity persecutors of all who would reform them as if they were enemies to them swhich is far indeed from being his case He frequently takes occasion from the doctrine oipredestination to despair of Divine mercy and so he abuses that great and fundamental doctrine Perceiving every object as through coloured and distorted medium he thinks that if the Lord hsA not elected him it will be altogether in vain fcr him ever to attempt believing and repenting and then he strongly imagines that he is not elected and therefore that it cannot be his duty to hope for the mercy of God But he would do well to recollect that all whom God hath predestinated to the end he hath also predestinated to the means that in choosing sinners to salvation he hath chosen them to faith and repentance not only as means but as necessary parts of salvation and that it is his present duty upon the warrant of the imlimited offer of the gospel to choose Christ for his Saviour and God in him for his God and immediately to trust in them for all the parts of salvation This would in the mean time be comfortable evidence to him that God hath chosen him To trust in the Lord Jesus for all his salvation and in the faith of offered and promised mercy 2Thwii i3 repent of all his sins arc the way to know that he has leen elected to faith and repentance as well as to every other part of salvation He always asserts that he cannot believe and lience concludes that he cannot be saved If any Christian friend exhort him to come as sinner to the compassionate Saviour and to trust in Him for salvation to himself in particular he is ready to reply Alas You seem to understand nothing fmy doleful condition otherwise you would not exhort such vile and unworthy sinner as am to trust that the holy One of God would ever save bim Indeed it would be daring presumption in one like me ever to attempt trusting in Him dare not will not cannot confide in him against whom have so heinously sinned His distemper so far as it prevails wUl not permit him to exercise failhA dreadful chastisement this for his having omitted the great duty of trusting at all times in the only Saviour when his imagination was sound He is at the same time utterly unable to exercise joy or to take comfort in any thing He cannot comprehend or so much as think of any thing which is suited to comfort him Wiien he reads or hears the dreadful threatcnings of the violated law it is always with application of them to himself but when he reads or hears the precious promises of the blessed gospel he either takes no notice of them orsays They do not belong to me the greater the mercy of God and the riches ot his grace are the more miserable am who have no part in them He looks upon his wife diildren friends house wealthand oll without the least comfort as man would do who is going for his crimes to suffer the most tormenting death He is like man in continual sicHness or pain who can not take pleasure in any thing around him because the feeling of his incessant pain prevents him He never reads or hears of any dreadful eicam pie of Divine judgment but he presently imagines that it will soon be his own case If he hears ol Cain or of Pharoah given up to hardne of heart or but reads that some are vessels of wrath fitted to destruction or that they have eyes and see not ears and hear not hearts and understand not he thinks that this is his very case or that it is all spoken of him If he hears of any tremenilous judgment inflicted on one he concludes that it will also be executed on liim if he is told that some person is become distracted or has died suddenly or died in despair he presently thinks that it will be so with himself The reading of Spirals dreadful condition has believe increased melancholy in many the ignorant author having de scribed case of the plainest and the deepest melanchtrly contracted by means of mental trouble arising from sin committed against conscience as if it had been the rational despair of sound uxh dcrstanding He persuades himself that none ever was in such dismal condition as that in which he is Although he be ever so often told that many of the saints have been in this very case yet hestill persists in saying Never was any ones case like mine His conscience is usually quicks in charging him with sin in presenting to his view the in finite punitsbment whidi he deserves for his sin aiul in urging him on to still greater dejection of mind as his duty But he seems dead to all the duties which directly tend to his consolation such as praiiQg the Lord thanksgiving for manifold mercies meditating on the glorious Redeemer and on the love the grace and the promises of God Press these and such as these ever so frequently upon him and he will make no conscience of them he will regard them as duties for others but not for him He is always displeased and discontented soith him sIf just as peevish or froward person is apt to be with others Is such man hard to be picased Is he ready to find fault with every thing which he sees or hears of and is he offended with every one who conies in his way Just so is melancholy man with respect to himself he is always suspicious of liimself always findiag fault always displeased with himself liis tliouglits for the most part arc turned inward upon himself Like millstones which grind on themselves when they have no grain between them his thoughts are usually employed upon themselves When he suspects that lie has thought irregularly he thinks again and again on that which he has already been thinking of He does not usually meditate much on God except on his terrible majesty justice and wrath nor on Christ nor heaven nor the state of the church nor indeed on any thing without himself his thoughts are all abstracted and turned inward upon himself and are such as tend not to alleviate but rather to increase his perturbation His musing on him self is chiefly that he may perceive the working of Satan in himself diat he may find in the de pravity or infirmity of his nature as much of the hateful image of that wicked one as he can but the holy image of God in him be frowardly overlooks and will not acknowledge And so as noble objects of thought raise the soul as amiable objects kindle love in it as cheering objects fill it with delight and as God in Christ who possesses every excdlence doth elevate and perfect and make it happy so mean objects of thought debase it loathsome objects fill it witii disgust and mournfiil objects impress it with sadness To fix therefore his thoughts incessantly ujxffl his depravity and misery cannot fail increase the sadness of bis spirit He commonly gives himself up to idieness either lying in bed or sitting unprofitably by himself he is much averse from labour especially from the work of his JisNal calling At the same time he is daily harassed with Jears of want poverty and Tnisefiy to himself and his family and sometimes even of imprisonment or banishment He is often afraid tliat some body will murder him and if he but perceives any one whispering to anotlier or winking with the eye Jie presently suspects that they are plotting to take away his life He is weafy qfcompaniy for the most part and is much addicted to solitude His thoughts are commonly all perplexed like those of man who is in labyrinth or pathlesiB wilderness or who has lost his way in the dark He is continually xring find groping about and IN TRUE CHRISTIAN 169 can make out notliing but is bewildered and entangled die more and he is full of perplering karSf out of which he cannot find the way He is for ordinary endless in his scruples afiraid lest he sin in every thought every word every look in all the food that he eats and in all the clothing that he wears and if he resolves to amend his ways he is still scrupulous with regard to his designed amendments He dares neither ypeak nor be silent neither travel nor stay at home but scruples eveiy thing as if his conscience were whoUy enslaved by selfperplexing scruples Hence it comes to pass that he commonly adfficts himself much to superstzlion He makes laws for himself which God never made for him He ensnares himself by unnecessary resolutions vows and austerities He places much of his religion in outward selfimposed tasks such as to spend so many hours of every day in this or that act of devotion to wear such and such clothes and forbear others that are fitter for him to forbear all sorts of food that please the taste and such like He lias lost the power of governing his thought by reason If Christian friend exhort him ever so earnestly and frequently to forbear his unprofitable selfperplexing thoughts and to turn his mind to cheering objects he is unable to comply He seems to be binder necessity of thinking anxious and listracting thouglits he cannot turn away his mind from gloomy and frigittful ideas He cannot meditate on redeeming lovo grace or niercy He can no more cease to muse on that vhich ia already the subject of his thougtei than inaD afflicted with violent toothacb can fur bear at the time to think of his pain Hence he usually becomes incapable to engage in secret prayer or meditation When he would try to pray or to meditate his thoughts are presently thrown all into confusion He cannot fix or keep them upon any object without himself for distempered and confused imagination wiUi weak reason whidi cannot govern it is the very disease with which he is afflicted Sometimes terror drives him from prayer He dares not hope and therefore dares not pray and usually he has not courage to receive the Lords Supper If he be at any time prevailed on to receive it he is presentjr filled with dread fearing that by partaking mn worthily he has eaten and drunk judgment to himself The consequence is that he begins to feel an uncommon degree of aversetiess from religious exercises Hence he rashly concludes that he is hater of God and of holiness imputing the fects of his bodily distemper to his soul while yet he would rather love God and be holy tbari have all the riches honours and pleasures in the universe Strictly speaking it is rather to the renewed perplexity and terror which he experiences in those exercises that he is averse than to the duties themselves for he still desires to have that calnmess of spirit that confidence and delight in the Lord Jesus which he would be glad to express by prayer and praise Here weought to distinguii between that degree of averseness which is so predominant as habituaUy and entirely to ptiercQmc holiness in the aoul and ftat degree ioh indeed strives vehemently against it bu 38 not oveTcome it Every holy man has some lee of backwardness to spiritual exercises re ining in him hat if this had dominion over he would willingfy abandon them which hm ar from being permitted ever to do Still howr he may when he is under melancholy be sd erred from someernaluties as to give them for time Many real believers have for ion been deterred from receiving the Sacrament lie Supper Some of them when under deep lancholy and strong temptation have even given outward prayer hearing and reading of the rd of God and yet they have not lost Uieir dee of holiness which is inward prayer nor their lire to believe love and obey the gospel He is commonly occupied much with eager and fiiciifig thoughts He now and then feels as if aething were speaking within him and as if all own violent thoughts were the impulses and adings of another He therefore uses fremdy to attribute his irregular fancies either to oe extraordinary motions of the Holy Spirit or tn to some uncommon agency of Satcui He of uses such expressions as these It was im issed OD niy heart or It was said to me that 8t do thus and thus and soon aftenards was that must not do this or that He con veshat his imagination is something talking hin him and saying to him ail that he is think of Hence he becomes intractable and very obstinate adhering to his own conceits It is with the ut St dffieultyi that be can be persuaded to rdSnfe H2 quish aiiy one of tbeniy however irrational He at the same time becomes peevish and froward it iB easy to oiFend him and difficult to please him It is seldom that the most convincing argumenij or that the best advice though pressed upon him in the most afTectionate and attractive manner does Km any good If Christian friend tries to persuade him that he has some evidences of work of grace begun in his soul and so far succeeds as to lessen in small degree the dejection ef his mind yet as soon as he again viewshis heart and life tlirough the medium of his perturbing humours every such argument and advice is forgotten and he is as far from serenity of mind as ever Any encouraging thought of his state to whid one can be the taeans of helping him seldom codp tinues above iy or two When his melancholy becomes deep he is id most constantly troubled with Iiideous and blasphfrinous temptaturnsy against God or Christ or the Scripture gr the immortality of the soul These SLYise partly from his own fears which make him think most of that of which he is most afraid to think The very uneasiness occasioned by his fears attracts and confines his thoughts to that which he dreads As lie who is over desirous jo sleeping and is fearing that he shall not sleep is Ukelyto continue awake because his desire and fear keep liim waking so the fears and anxieties of him who is melancholy do counteract themselves But these temptations arise chiefly from Satan who seizing the opportunity of the Christians beiog under that disease vexes him and tempts himi to blasphemous Aougbts FoTy as that crafty and malipious ejoe iriy of the saints knows that he can more easily and successfull tempt melancholy saint to unbelieving despairing and blasphemous thoughts than any other saint so when permitted he will be sure vehemently to instigate him to such thoughts Hence good man when he is under strong melancholy often feels as if something within him was forcibly urging him to utter some blasphemous or sinful expression and he can have no rest unless he yield to the temptation but no sooner docs he yield than he is tempted utterly to despair because he has committed so heinous sin and when Satan has gained this advantage over him he still to increase his dejection of spirit sets it before him It is wonderful what extraordinary acuteness the Christian under this grievous distemper will discover in evading the force of the strongest arguments that can be urged for his comfort but believe that Satan is on such occasions permitted to suggest his answers to him and to assist him in setting them in the strongest light possible Upon the tempters gaining that advantage oyer bim he further prompts him to conchide that he has been guilty of the sin against the Holif Spirit which will never be forgiven him This increases his despair of mercy The man who indeed commits that honible sin must be pixfessed infidel and that in opposition to confessed miracles And yet the melancholy believer detpairs because he dresids that he has committed that sin though perhaps he neither imderstands what it is nor has any reason but his own groundless fear or some blasphemous temptation which he auhors iot sfl Jtl3 gining tliat he has been guilty of it Alas he does not consider that temptation is one thing and sin another and that no man has less cause to fear that he shall be condemned for his transgression than he who abhorreth sin most and is least willing to commit it or no man can be less willing to commit iniquity than the Christian aflSictcd with melancholy is to be guilty of those blasphemous and hideous thoughts of which fie bitterly complains When good man under deep melandioly has been long harassed with suggestions to blasphemy and despair he at length begins to dready thafc Itf is possessed hy Satan man may be said tir be possessed by Satan when that enemy is at my time permitted to exercise in certain measure his power on him and that by stated and effieo tual operation either on his soul or on his body The devil thus possesses the souls of the ungodlyf but he is never permitted for single mom2tljiu to possess those of the suints But tliough ke aanot possess the souls of any of the saints yet he may as in the case of Job be suffered to possess for season the bodies of sonje of tliem He may perhaps in tlic hand of the Lord be an instrument of inflicting among other distempers the disease of melancholy on them and ho may also by harassing them with horrible and deairi3ig 8Ug gestions be an instrument of increasing that grievous disease But let it still be remembered by the dejected believer that Satans exercising for season such power on the body as may be ifcrmed Ejh ii possession of it is no sign at all of an unregcncrate state or of bis having gained possession again of that soul from which he had in the day of regeneration been cast out StiU however as this malicious and cruel enemy often raises storm of persecution against the Christian from without so in proportion as the Lord perniitteth him he likewise produces trouble within It should also be regarded by the disconsolate saint as matter of unspeakable comfort that of all men none loves the sin under which he siglis less than he does it is the heaviest burthen of his soul and that BO evinceth Satans possession of soul but fliat which the man loves more than he hates flind which he would rather keep than forsake Tlie melancholy Christian should likewise for his encouragement recollect that God will charge his femptations only upon Satan himself and nowise QpoB him so long as he receives them not by the teaaaent of his will but continues to abhor them ind that he will no more condemn him for those tfvilefficts which produced by tlic force of bodify disease are unavoidable than he will condemn man for raving thoughts or words in strong fever or delirium But so far as reason in the dejected Christian yet has power and his understanding the government of his passions it is doubtless his own fault if he do not exert himself in using that power though the great difEculty of using it renders his fault the less If his melancholy become very deep the dgected believer often imagines that he Jjcafs voicesand Ps ciil 13 14 sees lights and apparitions or that something meets him and sajs this or that to him when ally but the error of diseased imagination and an impaired intellect In consequence of the continued and harassing perplexity of his mind under strong melancholy the dejected Christian becomes weaty even of his life Some under deep melancholy are strongly temptetl to make away with themselves and tlicy are assaulted with the temptation so incessantly and so forcibly that they can go no where hut tiey feel as if somewhat within were instigating themvehemently and saying Doit For the grievous disease under which they labour will permit thbm to feel nothing but anguish and despair and to say nothing but that they are forsaken and miserable and undone It not only makes them weary of their lives even while they are sore afraid to die but it affords Satan siecial opportunity to urge them to destroy themselves so that if they by themselves happen to be crossing oiri bridge he urges them to leap into the water if they when alone see knife or any other destiHictive weapon he instigates them to kill themselves with it and they usually feel as if sometliing within them were importunately urging them saying Do it do it instantly Hence some of them begin secretly to contrive how they rnay accoiiiplish it yea and so far yield to the importunity of the tempter as actually to destroy themselves This undoubtedly would be selfmurder were it not that the doleful distemper under which they labour so impairs their undcrstandinjji as to render tliem at the time incapable to resists the horrible temptation Although the use of means for the preservation and recovery of Christians afflicted with melancholy belongs as much to others connected with them as to themselves yet so far as it is possi ble for themselves to exercise their reason they must be warned To abhor all such temptations and not for moment to give place to them in their minds To azoid carfuUij all occasions of yielding to them soas not to go near river or any instrument which Satan would instigate thenr to use for that purpose And to tnake Anouon their case without delay to some of their Christian friends in order that suitable means may be employed for their preservation and restoration to health Pfnally The dejected Christain after all will not believef that he is under the disease of melancholy but will be displeased if he hear any friend so niuch as hint it to him and will affirm that it is but the rational sense of his extreme misery or of being utterly forsaken by God and of lying under his terrible wrath It is therefore with no small difficulty that he can be persuaded to observe the prescriptions and directions of Physician or to employ any means whatever for the cure of his bodily disease asserting that his body is in perfect health and that it is only his soul that is troubled These arey for the most part the signs of melui For the cteater part of these digns of melancholy bavs bectt ioAtbied to Cliffords CoiiciiiQiu US choly especially when the true Christian is in that dismal casea case to be pitied but never to be scorned Let uo man despise or vilify such fot men of all descriptions are liable to that grievous malady high and low learned and unlearned religious and irreligious yea and persons who have hitherto lived in the greatest jollity and luxury such have actually fallen under it as often as it bath pleased the Lord to make them thus feel some of the dreadful eifects of bis hot disptei sure for their aggravated transgressions of his holy law Sect IL lyireetioiu to Christians who are afflicted with melancholy If the disease has proceeded or become strong directions to those Christians themselves are commonly to little purpose because their minds are so weakened that they cannot comply with them But because in some especially when the distemper has but lately begun to seize thenr there is some power of understanding and of reason still remaining shall ofier them the following directions and advices Endeavour to widerstand weU the covenatU of grace Study without delay to attain just and clear views of the infinite riches suitableness and freeness of the grace of that everlasting covenant The better you understand and the more you think of that wonderful contract in which complete salvation is purchased promised and sure to you the more under the consoling influences of the Spirit of grace will your souls be sustined and your tempers be sweetened Think atofteaof the AFFLICTEb WITH MELANCHOLY 179 righteousness of Jesus Christ as of your own sinfulness as often of his fulness of grace as of your own emptiness of grace and as frequently of the boundless love grace and mercy of youi CovenantGod as of his majesty holmess and justice The way to diminish and even to overcome those terrors whicU arise from partial and false appre hensions of God is to attain spiritual clear and enlarged views of Him as God whose glory itis to be merciful and gracious even to the chief of sinners and who will certainly shew mercy to them who unfeignediy desire to honour him and to be eternal debtors to his redeeming grace for ail their salvation Let your thoughts also dwell Wk these cheering truths That the Lord Jesus liatfa according to that wellordered and sure covenant given such an infinite satisfaction to Divine justice for your sins as secures you from eternal death that he hath performed such perfect obedience to the Divine law as merits for you eternal life and that life eternal is to you the mfinitely free gii of God Bermly persuaded that the incarnate Redmer with his righteousness and fulness is in the gospel offered to you sinners of mankind Constantly believe not only that Heisableatid willing to save you but that by his eternal Father and himself he is freely wholly and particularly offered to yon Believe cordially the record that God giveth to youy eternal Ufe and that this life ht in his son Consider that it is not Rom VI 23 John vi 32 Isa Iv Bevxxii 17r your sin but your duty always to believe that tcr you in particular He giveth in offer his Son with righteousness and life eternal in Him and that it is not your sin but your duty likewise to believe that the Fathers authentic offer of him to you affords you warrant presently to confide in him ibr salvation to yourselves or to trust that he saveth and will continue to save vou It would be presumption in any of the fallen angels to trust in Iim for their salvation because he is not offered to them but it is not presumption in you but duty to confide in him for all your salvation because the offer the call and the conmiandment to believe in him are directed to you in eommoa with all other hearers of the gospel and these ibrd you right at all tinges to place the confidence of your hearts in him for graee and glory Believe then that seeing you

40 Isa ly AFFLICTED WITH MELANCHOLY 18 exct when ye can have the world along with him watch diligently against the inordinate love of earthly things for it will dispose you to indulge distracting care and repining opposition of spirit to the holy disposals of adorable providence It is anxious care and peevish discontent that are often at first the occasions of melancholy They usually so disturb mans mind to render it defenceless against those temptations respecting the state of his soul with which Satan will aftei wardt assail him The disquietness which hath been occasioned by outward crosses is then removed to his conscience and so inflames it that he begins to be for long season oppressed with many fears about the salvation of his soul Thus as if the Lord had not afflicted him enough he adds to his own affliction Only consider how heinous sin it is soto love the world as to set up your own wills in opposition to the holy will and providence of the Most High By repining against Him you secretly accuse him and by accusing him ye blaspheme his worthy name Consider that the resignation of your wills in every thing to the will of God is principal branch of hoUness and that it is in proportion as ye take complacency in His blessed will that your hearts are comforted be persuaded to trust firmly that God in Christ loveth you and bestoweth Himself upon you as your everlasting portion and that the Lord Jesus will give you that which is goodf and withhold no good thing from you for that is the way through the Spirit to mortify the inordinate love of the world Be

to yoiiy it is season of great danger If the devil with His temptations as saultcii Christ himself when he found Him in wilderness rmfte from company much nrore will he assail you if he find you solitary It is your dirty therefore to be as often as attention to your other duties will permit in the company of humble faithful and clieerful Christians especially of those whose views of the gospel are clear whose faith is strong and who can speak from experience of deliverance from dejection of spirit It may also be of advantage to you if ye confer at time even with Christians whose cases are similar to your own in order to be satisfied that your condition is far from being singular Recollect frequently that although it is sia to yield to temptation yet it is not sin to be tempted Jesus Christ himself was in all points tempted like las we are yet without sin was tempted to the most atrocious and horrible sins yea evento fall down and worship the devil and yet having with perfect abhorrence resisted every temptation He still was without sin You can at no time be tempted to more horrible iniquities than those to which the holy One of God uras tempted Though you cannot endure tempta tion without sin as He coukl yet as it is not Ub vv i5 everysinful inclination in the heart of believer thflt is to be considered as compliance with temptation ye should not charge upon yourselves that which is the sin only of the tempter Consider how much it giatifies Satan to see you indulging gloomy and despondent thoughts It pleases that gloomy spirit exceedingly to perceive you sollen and melancholy like himself to behold you distrusting your Saviour and suspecting your God to be an enemy to you and that under the pretence of being deeply humbled and grieved for your sins That surely cannot be either your duty or your ornament which gratifies the devil and serves to promote the interests of his kingdom That can be no honour to you which robs your gracious God and Father of the honour of his redeeming grace and which disposes you to hate him and to flee from his presence as if he was your implacable enemy Meditate frequently on the promises and grace of the gospel but let each of your meditations be short and easy deep and continued meditation will but harass and perplex your minds and render you the more unable to perform your other duties Your imagination and mind are at present so weakened that you cannot employ them in fixed and protracted meditation without increasing thereby your malady Do not mistake my meaning am not directing you to neglect meditation especially on consoling subjects but to forbear deep and iong meditation because in your present condition it will strengthen your painful distemper short meditation on some cheering subject ma be mean of lessening and even of remoing jour dejection whereas deep and continued meditation will distract you and by increasing your dis ease will render you the less able to perform the other duties incumbent on you When ye are at any time meditating do not look down into the gloomy dungeon of your own heart where at present nothing can be seen but darkness or confusion but look away from yourselves 16 the compassionate Redeemer and to God as God of infinite grace in Him Instead of poring on your own hearts to discern if love to Christ be there you ought rather to be thinking of the infinite loveliness of Christ and of bis love to you Tbi would be the means of exciting the exercise ai your love to him and of bringing it forth to your vievr sight of your own hearts will but render you the more melancholy whereas beKev ing view of the glorious grace of the Redeemeri will comfort you Frequent thoughts of the Lamb of God who loved you and gave himself for you and of the love and mercy of God in Him would through the Holy Spirit produce sweetness and love in your hearts when on the contrary fixed thoughts of siii and of the wrath of God would beget bitterness and aversion of spirit from him Be frequently employed in ejaculatory prayer and let your stated prayers be shorter than ordinary In your present case you are not able to continue in these holy exercises so long as formerly Since therefore ye cannot do as ye would ye should do as you can If sickness or pain of body excuses man for being short in devotional duties because vntuvQ is then so

confession of sins Were ye to employ even more of the time in thanksgiving and praise than in confession and coniplaint it might under the influices of the blessed Comforter be mean of lessening or even of removing the bitterness of your spirits 10 Be not discouraged though in your holy exercises you have no lively feelings nor elevating conceptions These however desirable and useful they are yet cannot in your present condition be reasonably expected Although they are sometimes enjoyed by many holy persons yet they ore not the essentials of true holiness Lively feelings depend more on ones natural constitution tliau many are willing to allow Some Christians have naturally quicker sensibility than others very imaU affair will make some of them feel deeply They who live nearest to God are commonly not those who hav the liveliest feelings and emotiou of joy or grief but those who are most jconforiil ed to the holy image of the Son of God and wbo from principles of faitii and love are most devoted to Him and most inclined at all times to do his will Many believers epecially when dejected in spirit have bewailed bitterly their want of deep feelings who if their feelings had been but in the smallest degree deeper or livelier than they already were might have been disordered and even distracted by them II Be diligent from principles of faith and love in dcing the work of your lawful calling Be con stantly occupied as far as your bodily strength will permit in doing seasonably your proper workj and consider that it is very sinful as well as dangerous to squander any part of your precious time in idleness The Lord bath commanded you to labour six days and therefore you cannot neglect prosecuting your secular business without omitting your duty and thereby incurring in still higher degree the displeasure of your heavenly Father Besides if ye allow yourselves but for short season to be unemployed Satan will be sure to find employment for you By being idle you invite him both to tempt and to trouble you and he will not fail instantly to seize an opportunity very favourable to his design Then ye will have leisure to hearken to him and to revolve in your minds every one of his infernal suggestions Your precious time is continually hasting away and the Lord hath allowed you none to consume in idle oess If then you notwithstanding allow yourselves to squander any part of it in sloth you JQAjK threhy provoke the Lord to permit Satai 4o harass you in very uncommon degree No pretence of employing your time in exercises of devotion wiil excuse your idleness for you are omitting that duty which the holy law of God re quires Besides you should consider that to ejnploy your time as formerly in the work of your lawful vocation especially if it be in

despise his judgment concerning either your dejection or the means to be used for the removal of it Be directed by him with respect to the subjects of your thoughts the objects of your fears the scruples of your consciences and the manner of your devotional exercises Be not wise in your own conceits Do not obstinately adhere to every fancy that strikes your minds but distrusting your own

body and the mind once It disquiets mans mind disorders his thoughts and fills his soul with anguish and horror Look then on such Christian friends as are under this dreadful distemper with the greatest pity and tenderness Considering that ye yourv selves are also in the body and are obnoxious to the same overwlielining malady regard them with the most affectionate and tender sympathy They are dely afflicted in body and sore vexed in spirit Their minds are troubled Their spirits are dgected Their consciences are iuflamcd Their sighs are deep The language of their doleful condition especially to yon is the same as that of Job to his friends Have pity upon me have pity upon me ye my friends for the hand of God hath touched me Pray frequently andjeroenily to the Lord for them and request other Christians to pray for them likewise In presenting your supplications for them you have strong arguments to plead Ye may plead that the Lord Jesus endured unparalleled anguish of soul as well as torment of body for them that their trouble is so great and overwhelming that none but He can help or deliver them that tlie more insupportable their anguish and terror are the more illustriously will his Job ix 21 192 ADVICES TO RELATIONS AND FRIENDS OF power and mercy be displayed in delivering tiem that the more dismal and formidable their distress is the more gloriously will the kindness of his love be manifested in creating peace to their troubled souls and that the less others cando to relieve them and the more unworthy of relief they are the more brightly will the glory of hia redeeming grace shine in saving them And though they may under deep despondency and terror even forbid you to pray any more for thera yet persist you still in sending up your supplications to the Father of mercies in their behalf and in requesting others to do the same for if the LcHd stir up you and his saints around you to continue instant in prayer for them he will in dne season stir up his strength and come and save them The Lord Jesus saith to his disciples If two of you sliall agree on earth as toucliing any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven Accordingly when many of the saints were gathered together and employed in praying for Peter who was kept in prison the Lord delivered him at the very time in which they were presenting their sujv plications for his deliverance St tidy frequently to suggest groimds of comfort to them by telling them especially that the Lord can and that you trust he will shortly

give them ome faint hope of deliverance which will alleviate their doleful trouble and conflcle their wounded spirit 4w Often remind them of the infinitely rich and iree grace of the Lord Jesus of his being in the gospel freely and wholly offered to them and of ihe ample warrant afforded them by the offer to trust in him for all salvation to themselves in particular Exhort them daily to come as

this is their greatest sin Urge them daily to trust that the JLord Jesus lovetli them with free an immense and an everlasting love and that be will surely bestow upon them all the salvation that he

thereby throw them into still deeper perturbation of sjMrit and this will increase their malady If the distemper has not yet advanced far you may indeed if necessajry often exhort them to do any thing that can easily be done and to engage in the exercises of seoiid and public worship but even this must be donci not in peremptory but in gentle and aPeationate manner 11 At the same time do not if

is piident and cautious If one can be found who has himself in any degree been afflicted with that grievous malady and who has by the blessing of God cured some who had been under it he should in preference to any other be consulted and his prescriptions and directions ought to be so carefully observed as even in cases of extremity to force if it cannot be otherwise attained the afflicted persons to comply Fbom what has been advanced in this Chapter it will hope be obvious to the intelligent and candid reader that true religion is neither thecause nor the effect of melancholy It cannot be the cause of melancholy for many have been and many are truly religious who have never appeared in the smallest degree to be underthe disease of melancholy Were genuine religion the cause of melancholy it would undoubtedly have been so in the case of all who have exhibited satisfactory evidences of their godly sincerity livery religious man would inevitably be affllicted with that dreadful malady yea he would be oppressed with it usually in the very degree in which he is religious But so far is this iiom being the case that on the contrary instances not few have been found of persons horn pure religion For several of these Advices have been irdrbted to Mr Timothy Rogers Preface to hU Uieouise oa Tioubie of Mind and Melarchelj has Biost effctually cured even of deep melan choly Peace with Crod and peace of conscience together with the exercise of supreme love to God have in many instances removed deeplyrooted melancholy andthatj after it had resisted all the power of medicines Joy and peace in believing have by the Divine blessing often dSected the cure without the help of medicines especially in those cases in which the melancholy constitution of the body had been produced by trouble of mkid True religion then when it has its due effect upon the heart is so far from bemg the cause that it is the best cure of melancholy As religion is not the cause so neither is ite effict of melancholy Were true religion the of melancholy every melancholy man would be come truly religious and his degree of genuine xellgton would be in exact proportion to his degree of melancholy so that the more aC flicted with that direful malady he were the more joy and peace in believing and the more love to God and delight in him would he at the same time experience But instead of this it appears in fact that the greater number of those who are under the disease of melancholy consists of persons who are entire strangers yea and some of them avowed enemies to true religion Faitfa holiness and spiritua comfort which constitute real religion are so far from being the effects of melancholy that the disease of melancholy is in itseltj great hinderance to them It is true that the Lord may render this dreadful malady subser vient to faith holiness and comfort a3 he sometimes doth legal terror but botK the one and the Other are in themselves obstnictions to thenar Melancholy indeed effects slavish fears legal terrors and endless scruples but these constitute no part of pure religion for in proportion as religion is increased in the heart and life of the believer these are diminished To say then either that genuine religion makes persons melancholy or that melancholy renders people truly religious is to utter an ignorant ainl ai impudent slauder gainst our holy religion No man who has thfc smallest experience of Godliness can deliberately reproach it in that manner Some of the saints it is granted are sometimes melancholy but this is not because they are religious but either because theyfind that they have too little of religion or because they fear that they have none at aiH Melancholy therefore instead of being styled reltgi ouSy should rather humbly apprehend be termed superstitious melancholy for while this distemper makes no man truly religious it has direct tendency to render all who are afflicted with it whe ther they be converted or unconverted superstitious Hence the devout reader may also learn that so much doth the direful disease of melancholy weaken the mind of holy man while be is under it that he not only cannot but will fwty be sensible of joy or of any other grace in himself So fai as that doleful malady prevails it renders him sullen and averse from seeing or feeling or attending to any thing which might afibrd him comfort It makes bim willing to despond and unwilling to See HxNRT on the Pleasantness of teUoA 16 S04 REFLECTIONS ancholy is it is infinitely more desirable even tobe melmicholy

begin to cast up mipe and dirt When Christians are at ease they sometimes think that their corruptions are not strong and ihat their graces are not sq weak as they really are they flatter tliemselves that thoir sanctiiication is much further advanced than it actually is But when their comfort is gone and their hearts are troubled what unbelief what pride what deadness what enmity against holy God what impatience what nmrmuring what strange unbecoming thoughts of God arise and appear in their hearts which they never before could eitlier feel or believe to be there Mental trouble serves in the hand of the Holy Spirit to shew them how deeply rooted how inveterate how malignant their depravity is and what reason they have to be greatly ashamed and to blush before the omniscientaud holy Lord God It was upon Jobs having been grievously afflicted in spirit that he discerned more vileness in his heart than he could formerly have suspected to be in it and that he learned deeply to abhor himself as sinner There are abominations which like nests of vipers lie so quietly within that believers do not suspect them to be there till the xod spiritual trouble disturbs and arouses them TO OS

from the bottom of the heart such deep corruptions to view as the most enlightened of the saints could otherwise scarcely have conceived to be there and discoveries esspedaUy of tkese are necessary to

because it is bittei because it reachetkuoto thine heart As the Lord never chasteneth any of his children but for their profit so he never afflicteth them with spiritual trouble except when it is necessary for that purpose Accordingly the aposUe Peter saith Ye are now for season if need be in heaviness through manifold temptations By suspending his influences of consolation from their souls and so imbittering their sins to them the Lord weakeneth the remains of corruption in them Jer ii 19 Jer iv 18 Hab xii ID Pet J210 DESIGNS or gods permitting believers He thereby renders them more

their having made for themselves saviour of their pleasant frames by relying on them rather than on Jesus Christ By permitting dis trust and despondency to prevail against thaOf and so to occasion

setting small value upon his favour and the light of his countenance If ha layeth them under painful sense of his anger it is to make them sensible of their folly as well as ingratitude in provoking his displeasure By piercing their hearts with deep sorrow he teaches them the sinfulness of their having pierced his be loved Son and grieved his Holy Spirit If he maketh them experience the tenor of his vindictive wrath or the dread of suffering through eternity the pains of hell it is to teach them the extreme folly of their not having been afraid of sinning against him One part of his design ia

them for time to lose siglit of their evidences of grace he teaches them that they ought never to be proud of their attainments in religion nor to trust in grace received If he appears not to stand in the relation of Father to tliem it is to render them more sensible that they have not acted the part of obedient children to him By seeming to shut out their prayers he reproves them for restraining prayer and for their unbelieving wandering and vain thoughts in prayer When he permits them to be afraid that they are yet under the dominion of spiritual death it is to teach them tlie great evil of deadness and coldness of heart in thir acts of worship If he denies them his reTiring and consoling presence in reading and hearing his blessed word it is to make them deeply sensible of the sinfulness of their having despised his glorious gospeL And if he leaveth any of thern to fell into some gross and open sin his design may be to chasten them for having suffered themselves to commit secret iniquity By thus chastening them the Lord instmcteth them in the exceeding sinfulness of their sin in order that they may so bewail and abhor it as to turn with fuller determination of heart from it to Him as their gra cious God and Fatlier Hereby he also teaches them that if he leave them but for single moment they will instantly fall even into the most atrocious crimes Ah how deep how

tliose graces are not only roanifestedto their consciences but are strengthened Bnd increased by their exercise of them The same affliction that serves in the hand of the Holy Spirit to try and discover their graces serves also to excite them to exercise and the more they are exercised the more the habit of them is strengthened When the Lord thus chasteneth any of his ear children it is invariably for their profit that Ahey may be partakers of his holiness For this cliastening though for the piesent it is not joyous but grievous exceedingly grievous nevertheless afterwards it yiekleth the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them who are exercised thereby It supplies them in the mean time wrth special occasions for striving and wrestling agam Iheir spiritual enemies for swiming against the eam for pressing on as through an opposing crowd and thus their graces have special oppor tunities afforded them of becoming stronger by frequent exercise It affords occasion for many actings of faith and love of repentance and resignation and for many ardent longings and heavei ly breathing which otherwise wouki not perhaps be experienced Besides the exercise of the graces of his Holy Spirit in believers especially of that grace in which eacfh of them excels is so pleasing to the Lord that he will on no account sufler them to want occasion nay frequent occasion for such exercise His design also in withholding consolation is to teach them by experience their continual need of living upon Christ by faith and so to raider Him the more precious to them will leave iu the

is that they may be stirred up to search the Scrips tureSf mare earnestlj and more frequently it is to moke them capable of relishing and of esteeming his glorious gospel tlie more One great design of

and especially without some degree of spiritual trouble they would at least many of tliem would be but slightly affected with the doctrines and promises of the gospd because they could not feel their need of that consolation which many of these are designed to afford If they had no burthens to weigh them down no fears to disquiet them no distress of conscience to exercise them much of the good

see the inestimable value of superabounding grace One of the designs of God therefire in laying any of his people in the depths of spiritual trouble is that they may in their deliverance see what reason they have highly to prize and gratefully to adore the transcendent riches and freeness of his glorious grace that when they are delivered from the sorrows of death whidi compassed them and from

after they had been sinking in the waters of trouble he bath settheir feet upon rock and filledthem with joy and peace in believing when say they are made to experience so great deliverance they cannot fail to be deeply affected with the sovereignty the riches and the freness of redeeming grace One design of God then in the infliction of men tal distress upon any of hissaints and afterwards in delivering them from it is to afford them sp cial opportunities of esteeming admiring and adoring his immense love and boundless grace to them Hereby his glorious method of salvation by Jesus Christ is exceedingly endeared to their souls Another end which the Lord hath in permitting some of the saints so to lose their spiritual comfort as to be disquieted in spirit is that thereby be may

of that Fhy ftician who by having been afflicted with the same distemper hath much experience of it than to that of another who never was afflicted with it so troubled souls will be more attentive to and more affected by the advices and leouragements suggested by that Christian who speaks to them from his own experience than by those of any other Christian 12 It is likewise the intention of God by that most painful discipline to prepare some of his childxetif for special and eminent service to Him Some believers continue aU their days in low way and have neither much trouble nor much comfort they experience little distressing fear and as little joyful hope Thei are believers of lower class Others again are raised up aloft in flashes and even in raptures of sensible joy but they do not perceive distinctly the objects which are below various mistakes and failings and improprieties in their mind and conduct do alsnest entirely escape their notice These too are Christians of an inferior rank But when the Lord is training up any of his redeemed for special and eminent service to him he commonly brinjgs diem low and employs them in deep exercises and sharpconflicts with motions of sin within and temptatioDs of Satan from without He bringeth them into depths of iritaal trouble and giveth them deep humbling and cen irightfal discoTeries of the strength and sinfulness of the unbelief and other abominations which lie deep in their hearts He bideth his face from them and permits their spiritual enemies frequently to assault them and sometimes to prevail so against them as to threaten their eternal destruction At the same time he secretly upholds them and when the design of the disprnmtinn is gained he comforts them with deliverancei Thus he advances them to higher de grees of experimental knowledge to more enlarged views of themselves and of Christ of sin and of hdiness and of the suitableness riches and freeness of redeeming grace than other believers attain He thereby renders them more intelligent wise and humble more deeply sensible of their infinite obligations tohim more disposed to trust firmly and at all times in the Lord Jesus and more zealous lively and active for his glory than the generality of other believers and so lie prepares them for special serviceand eminent usefulness in their generation Some think and indeed it is probable that Heman was laid in the dark ness and the depths expressed in the IxxxviiL Psalm in order that he might be qualified for that eminent station in tlie Church to which he was raised Doubtless it is in proportion as believers attain deep experience that they have the capacity and especially the wisdom requisite for superior usefulness in the Church of Christ 13 Another purpose

sufierings of Christ their Covenanthead is perhaps the display of it which is afibrded in the suflerings especially in the mental suflerings of the members of his mystical body The glory of his

and the glory of his sovereignty in thus afflicting for their good whomsoever whensoever and in what degree soever he pleaseth He displays the glory of his infinite sovereignty by dispensing to his people trouble and comfort sorrow and gladness just as it pleases him Upon that ground Eiihu vindicated the Lords afflicting of Job without questioning as Jobs other three friends bad done his integrity will answer thee says he that God is greater than man Why do6t thou strive against him for he giveth not account of any of his matters By infflcting marital trouble on some of his saints the Most High dieweth tliem and others around them whatbe Job xiLxuL 12 13 TO LOSX THEIR SPIRITUAL COMFORT 235 tould do with them if he would By so doing he mttketh it manifest that it is He who formeth the light and createth darkness who maketh poace and createth evil He thereby makes them deeply sensible that all their comforts whether ontward or inward depend as entirely on His sovereign pleasure as their election and regencration did From what has here been said disconsolate Jbielievers may see that the Lord never withholds ensible comfort from them but whenhis doing so isjbr their gpod in subservience to kis txcti gfonf Although the loss of spiritual consolation and the trouble of mind which ensues are in Ihenisehts diseouragements from holy practice and even ob ttnictions to it yet the Lord hath appointed that many of the saints shall sometimes be afflicted with these in order that they may in his hand subserve the designs of his grace in theii sanctifi cation and salvation Were believers always alike were they continually in lively fraiiie could tliey invariably exercise ardent love and sensible joy they would begin to think that the lower to do so was inherent and that it was in great measure their own But when by means of their want of consolation they are made deeply sensible that of themselves they can do nothings and that they need to depend continually on Christ for supplies from his fulness they are hereby prepared to glorify him both by trusting in him and by advancing in conformity to hinu Isa xlvT 236 DESIGNS OF gods PERMITTIN Gbjeuevers Disconsolate Christian thou art ncfver laid in the furnace of spiritual trouble but when it is necessary for thy good Love therefore thy gractoiu God and Father who in all his dispensations consults thy welfare who never chastens thee but for thy profit that thou mayest be partaker of his holiness Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him For small moment he hath forsaken thee but with great mercies will he gather thee What is the reason that the gloripus gospel hath often appeared to thee too plaini to be practically undeistood and too good to be believed with application It is thy pride thy self righteous spirit Endure then with faith and patience that greatest of all afflictionsdistress of mind for by it thy heavenly Father is in answer to thy own earnest prayers destroying the pride tf thy heart From the foregoing particulars exercised Chris tiaiis may also see that when outward and inward troubles at any time meetT upon them thi is bo proof iiAer that they are unregenerate or that Gad their enemy Believer when thou art under great and sore troubles Satan will try to persuade thee that they are proofs of thy hypocrisy and that if God loved thee he would never subject thee to such long complicated and grievous calamities The construction which Jobs three friends put upon his complicated and grievous afflictions was that they evidenced him to be hypocrite and God to be his enemy When waters of full cup art measured out to thee do not conclude that God doth Heb 3tii 10 xx3rii Isa iiv TO LOSE THEIR SPIRITUAL COMFORT 237 not love thee or that thou art not one of his childTen For great as thy distresses are they are not only consistent with his love to thee but they pro ceed from it Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receivcth Others whom God hath loved have endured as great troubles as thou if not greater Heman suffered trors which threatened to overwhelm his amazed soul and that not for short season but from his youth up and yet instead of concluding that God was his enemy or that He did not love him he addressed God as the Lord God of his salvation Believers may hence see that ihe haoe no reason to be offended at the ways of godliness on account of any trouble how grievous soever it may be which they sometimes endure in those ways They have no sufficient reason to be weary or faint in their minds Their gracious God and

Lord is iiicting him If he do not know the particular design which the Lord may more immediately have in view in visiting him with his pre tent distress of soul let him study to have at leasts oC those ends of it gained upon him whioh have been explained above His duty is to trust firmly in the Ixird Jesus and also to pray frequently that all the designs which God usually hath ia thus ifflicting any of his children may be obtained upon him Perhaps the particular intentioB of his spiritual trouble is for season concealed from him in order that his heart may be set on having all the ends of the Lord in that most afflio tive dispensation gained upon him It is the glory of God to conceal thing Clouds and darkness are round about Him And therefore though it is the duty of holy man to inquire into the Lords principal design in hiding his face from him tliat he nfoy in his exercise strike in with that design yet it becomes him to search into it with the deepest reverence and humility and not to be so disappointed if he succeed not as to sink lower in depression of mind or to be deterred from any part of spiritual exercise On the contrary he ought by the frequent exercise

imported but from that distant and bet ter country It is God only the God of all comibrt to whom infinite mercy and power belong who can impart holy consolation to the sorrowful heart or pour the balm of peace into the wounded spirit It is only the adorable Spirit the Comforter who like Noahs dove can fly with the oliveleaf of peace to assure the troubled soul that the winter is past and that the rain is over and gone When holy man is walking in darkness the day of comfort will not dawn nor the shadows flee away till the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and he can no more command at his pleasure the rising of the spiritual Sun within than he can that of the natural sun without AH that he can do is in the strength of the grace whidi is in Christ Jesus io use means of recovering comfort or like tbef mariners in the ship with Paul to cust anchor and wish for the day The means which he ought to employ for that purpose must be means of Divine appoiDtment especially the following He ought in humble reUance on the grace of Christ to search out and confess to his heavenly Father those iniquififs which have prctVoked Him to hide his face from him He must without delay resolve as the Israelitish Church in captivity flid to search and try his ways and to turn gain to the Lord until the Lord look down and behold from heaven He ought to imitate David who when he was in distress of consciencei said to Jehovah acknowledged my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have not hid said will confess my transgressions unto the Lord and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin For thk shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in time when thou mayest be found One special design of tlie Lords hiding his face sometimes from many of his children is so to chasten them for some latent sins in their hearts or lives as to make them deeply sensible of them and of the horrible malignity of them in order that they may attain deeper humiliation and selfabhorrence The omniscient eye of God hath seen all those secret evils which either have escaped their own notice altogether or which they have carefully concealed from that of others while they could not but know that they were open to His view and it hath also beheld how much his own glorious majesty and spotless holiness have been fronted and insulted by them Hence are bis righteous Im ill 40 50 Pj xxxii

If conscience eport that this hath been neglected or that hath yeea done wroi they ought to trace that report the grounds of it and to search even into the leepest recesses of the heart And when

Lord Jesus the ithful trustee of tliat everlasting covenant which is well trdered in all things and sure Alas why do not saints shrink vnth horror from the first risings of unbe lief in them as they would do from atemptatioa to commit murder or any other enormous crime Unbelief is the radical evil of the depraved heart fiom which every other abominatioii issues It is also requisite in order to comfort that disquieted Christians be deeply convinced of the exceeding hurfffess of thoir sins in general and especiallyof theirunbelief They must without delay study to become deeply sensible that the unbelief which prevails against them and which passes in their minds under the disguise of humility and dread of presumption isa most deep dangerous and destructive eviL Their unbelief is the sourceto wUcb every other departure of their hearts from the living God may be traced It is the principal cause of all their iiritual trouble What is itbut their distrusting of Christ and their apprehending of God to be their enemy that increases the enmity against him tlie deadness of spirit the hardness of heart and the indisposition of soul to meditate on him as God of grace and topray to him which they feel What is it but their fearing that he doth not love them and their apprdiending that he is laying nares for theim or is watching for evil against them that fills their 90ulsiwith trouble and anguishi terror and dismayi aversion from him and weariness in every act pf service done to him Is it not their disbelief of his care and their distrust of his mercy that dispose them to put dark construction upon his dispensations to them and to sinkeven under the slightest pressures Let the disconsolate Christian thea assure himself tliat he Cannot attain holy comfort until he be convinced that his refusing to trust as sinner in Jesus Christ for salvation to himself isnot only exceediny sinful in the sight of God but inexpressibly Amftd to himselfi He should iaiordcr to recover spiritual consolation take heed that he do not make rash and dnperate conclusions againsl himself respectii that which is either past or present or future Whon holy man concludes rashly after he has had good evidence of his having been in astate of grace That he still in state of nature he bears filae witness against hunselfy and reflects dishonour on his faithful Redeemen He must dierefere strive against forming rash and sad conclusions against himself with respect to that which is past He ought not to conclude that he never hod the grace ofGod and that all Ihb pttst experience has been but delusion merely because he is nn walking in darkness and is not able to discern the evidences of that grace He should be much on his guard against thinking that he never wa

in trusting him Nor should he be afraid that his endeavouriiTg thus to trust is presumption Presumption is urmai rantable or groundless confidence It cannot then be presumption so long as he is conscious that he trusteth only in Christ and in God and that he places confidence in Christ and in God not upon the ground of any good thing in his own heart or life but only upon the Divine warrant which is afforded him in the gospel Nor ought he to fear chat he is acting presumptuously so long as he is conscious that he sincerely endea vours to trust in the Saviour not for part merely but for the whole of salvation not for salvation in any sin but for salvation from exery sin nt for salvation with sin or to sin but for that salva Ys Jxxi 21 Mic viL 19 tion which comprises universal holiness of heart and life not for salvation by his own righteousness but for salvation by grace reigning through the righteousness of Jesus Christ unto eternal life and for salvation not for his own glory but for the glory of Christ and of God in Him Presumption ako is unreasonable confidence But nothing can be more reasonable than that needy sinner come at the command of God and trust with firm confidence in Jesus Christ for all that salvation which is laid up in Christ laid out in the promise and brought near in the offer of the gospel And nothing on the coiitrar can be more unreasonable than to trust for that which it is impossible even for omnipotence itself to aflbrd and which the Saviour hath never promised to givesalvation in sinsalvation consistently with mans retaining of some darling lustsalvation merely from the punishment of sinsalvation in order to be at liberty to commit sin with impunity In few jwords The disconsolate Christian should not fear that his trusting in the Lord Jesus for salvation to himself in particular is presumptuous confi lence if it is accompanied withyar that he cloth not approve cordially the whole scheme of redemption delineated in the gospel with desire so to approve it and with diligence in the use of all the other means of grace within his reach In his endeavouring to trust cordially in the blessed Saviour for salvation he must not overlook the promises of salvation All the promises of Godf being in Christ yea and Amen are in and Acts XV 11 Rom 21 with Christ offered in thegospd tohim should therefore in applying Christ to bimsd embrace or apply the promises not indeed sepa rate from Christ but in and with Him imd be lieving that the absolute promises especially are in the ofi directed to him fbr his aocqitance be itiust rely on the faithfxilness of God in them iii4iich is pledged for the peribnnanoeof them andso trust in Christ for the performance of them tD himself To trust for salvation is to rely with confidence notonly cm Christ and hi rightecnisness but on the truth of the promises It is to rely and live upon Christ not as feh in the heart but as oflered and promised in the gospel andit must be of the same extent as the promises The absolute promises of the eternal covenant ore open They ai fvee The disquieted Christian therefore should cast himself freely upon them when feelings and evidences fail He has been trying if he had already personal interest in Xhe Redeemer and be has found no satisfying evidences of it in himsel Let him for little while forbear that incpiiry and in the mean time put the matter out of doubt by trusting that Christ now giveth him saving interest in Him Eyery scriptural evidence of personal interest in the Redeems is either com prised in faith or is consequence of faith Let his actings of faith in Christ and in the promise then be distinct and express in trder that he may be conscious that he is acting it and at the same time let him rest not on the act but on tfaeglori ous Object of his faith and draw consolatiiHi not Ps xci Lain iii 24 from tlie act but by tbe act from Christ and tbe promises Ta trust simply in the Lord Jesus for sahatioui to himself is

The believer should therefore expect great as well as good things from Him great deliverances and supplies great enlargements and consolations great mercy and peace and great salvation The Lord Jesus

repentance of the legal kt or hypocrite is not so much sorrow for sin aa sullen grief that he is not allowed to sin with impunity not so much turning from sin to the Lord as turning from one sin to

time that he hath to wait is but short Yet little while and the compassionate Saviour will come and save him The Xrord Jesus waited Job 17 Pb xciv 12 Genxxxii 10 Lam ill 2d Isa viii 17 Pst zxxviL 734

the time to vour him even the time be come and wait with patient and silent sesignatiou to the Divine will he Lord is waiting for the very same day of comfort for which the disconsolate saint is to wait and if the Lord cannot be disippointed so neither can be There is in the love of Christ to him an earnest kinging as it were that the day might oome And therefore he may in submission to the wiU of his gracious Gad lawfully pray as the htAy FaalmisU did even for adeUveKance But if his mental trouble still continue he muist resolve to wait patiently and to jtustify the infinitely wiae God

should with humbleness and calm Bess of qpirit wait upon the Lord Let him firmly resolve to wait Gods time and to bear Iiis firown in humble expectation that He will all length return and visit him with the light of his countenance and with the joy of his salvation IS It is ako requisite in order to recover true comfort that holy man be constantly on his guard against Riding to imy motion of sin in his heart and that he be pressing an toward mon jholiness of heart and of life He must in depesdance on the promise of saniw tification always take heed that donot tpM to IMaiy secret motion ef sin in his heart If he wouU lutve his conscience pacified and peaodui he most atrive to keep it pure Sin like Achan in the camp or Jonah in the ship is that which causetk iKoublew If the disconsolate believer allow himself br season to jidd to any motion of sin or temptation of Satan or of the worU he cannot be ay or comfortabfe in hit mind Althongh trawUev wese sura that he was to leaeh in safety the place to which he was going yet if he tra relied with thorn in his foot he could not but be sensible of pain at eery step If the Christian suffer himself to connive especially at that in himself which he knows to be wrong he can not but be disquieted Uprightnessand singleness of heart are necessary to his recovering of lost comfort God hath made an eternal separation between continuance in the love and practice of any sin and holy tranquillity of mind Let therefore the afflicted believer in the faith that Christ wilV strengthen him maintain resolute and continual struggle against the first risings the secret mo tions of depravity in his heait It is as natural for sin indulged to raise and iiicrense doubts and fears in his mindj as for rotten wood to breed worms Every instance of his yielding to motion of sin will be like blot upon his evidencesr for heaven Let him then in all his conflicts witb the risings of sin diligently study both to discoveri and to mortify the corruption ofhisnature both to sigh under the burthen and to act against the power of the sin that dweHeth in him It should always be his manner to attack and mortify sini in its Jirst risings for as that which usually de stroys his peace of conscience is his indulging of corrupt desires so his constant endeavour through grace to resist and quell them before they have time to acquire strength is sure mean of recover ing spiritual comfort He should also endeavour daily to attain more and more holiness heart and life True holineM consists of loving the Lord our God supremely of and of studying habitually to serre him wiih gladness aa weQ as with abhorrence of all iniquity Spiritual comfert accordingly is part of holinessThe more believer advances in universal holiness the more the principle and iaiof pureconsola tion does he possess and the more of the principle and habit of this holy comfort he attains thei more of the enjoyment of it shall he have in every time of need The disconsolate Christian then to the efid at he may recover sensible comfort should by failh receive out of the fulness of Christ greater measures of sanctifying grace that he may not only die daily to sin but live to righteousness He ought from principles of faithand love and for the glory of his redeeming God to become more and more diligent in all the duties of hcdiness This though it shall not merit coivsolation for him yet will in his experience be coir Bected with consolation yea it will itself be comfort to him Our rejoicing is this saith an Apostle the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God we have had our conversation in the worlds To be advancing sensibly in conformity to the Lord Jesus and in holy activity for his glory cannot fail to be very pleasing and encouraging to holy man Although die beginning of comfort in the soul is necessary to the practice of true holiness yet the pracMce of holiness is requisite to the increase of comfort and to the recovering of it after it hath in any measure been lost Let it then be the ardent Ps Cor 12 Js xxxlu 17 Tohaxiv 21 GaJ vi la S82 THE MEANS OF RECOVERING desire of the believers sou and the settled purpose of his heart to advance daily in the love and pcaotiee of universal holiness Let perfection of holiness be the ruling wish of his heart and thegreat purpose of his life to which he uniformly directs aU his efibrts Let his will be always in unioa with the will of Christ and with the glory of Grod dnd then Christ will give him the desires of his heart then he shall know by experience that supreme regard to the will and to the glory of Gody is the health and happiness of the souL 14 As mean of attaining the spiritual comfort which he desires the Christian if he be capabk mvk9t perform diligently the duties tfhi lauDfidcaU ing Though this forms part of the holiness mentioned in the particular immediately preceding yet the special importance of it as mean of CQSOf fort requires that it be considered by itselC Let the disconsolate believer take care that he regfxi idleness as continued omission of the duty ve quired in the eighth commandment of the moral law and that he abhor it as continued crime and as reproach to his holy profession To be idle even for single day without real and evi dent necessity is dangerous to any Christian bat especially to Chmtian in trouble of conscience It is tempting of Satan to come and find employment for him and it is leaving of himsdf at leisure to weigh one after another the temp tationa of that subtile and malicious enemy Heathen philosopher terms idleness The grave of living man and holy minister of the JPe XJPLvii Tiin gMpd 9tyh it The hell of living Christian Let the ditquieled Christian then lieoonstantly upon hi guard against idknesB and especially against disposition to be idle Let his heart as well as bis hands be exerdsed in voluntary and diligent peribmiance of the various duties of some honest and useful vocation otherwise his heart will woric out of itself still greater degree of trouble to him Idleness fieds and increases the distemper of tronhled soul whereas lawful enployment occu pies the mind and takes it off from poring inces saBtly upon the causes and aravations of the trouble When Elijah the prophet was in deprteiioq of mind the Lord would not sufler him to sit still in any place When he sat down under Junipertree an angel touched him and com jnanded him to arise and eat when he again lay down the Angel of the Lord second time roua ed him to action When he went to cave at Ho rebf in order to lodge there the word of the Lord came to him and said What dost thou here lijah Go forth and stand upon the mount before the Lord Soon afterwards when he was standing in the entrance to the cave the Lord again disturbed his repose and said to him Cio return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus If it is Christians duty even wb he is under the disease of melancholy to be diligent in business it is no less his duty when he is troubled in soul merely on spiritual account He must not therefore say either that he is disinclined to work or that his trouble is so great that be UPllble Xq work uiitilhe first be well satisfiied from the Orav des of truth that such excuses will be sustained at the tribunal of Christ the omniiBcient and righteous Judge of the world The Holy Comforter hath in wonderfid condescension visited with the joy of his salvation many thousandsof his saints at the very times in which irom regard to his authority they have been employed in the business of their several callings 15 If he have reason to apprehend that he is in any degree under melancholy which as has been observed above is bodily disease he should frequently ifitrwt his imagination to the blessed Redeemer that sovereign Physician of soul ao body in the hope that He will cure the distemper of it So long as the imagination continues weak and disordered it will present to the understanding eveD the most encouraging and amiable objects in distorted discouraging and unamiable form and so long as that is the case trouble of mind orsad ness of spirit must in greater ov less degree conIkiue The melancholy Christian therefore should not only trust in the compassionate Saviour for consolation to his troubled soul but he should in the use of other appointed means trust that solar as it can subserve the gbry of God in his salva tion Jesus will deliver him from the distemper his natural spirits He ought to trust in the great Redeemer for the health of his badyf which is the temple of the Holy Spirit as well as for the happiness of his soul in order that both soul and lKjdy may be prepared to serve the Lord with gladness He 48 fully warranted to rely with firiA confidence on the Lord Jesus for all that is necessary to enable him to glorily Gkd in his body and in his spirit which are Gods 16 To disclose the condition of his sotd to soYnd experienced and judicious Minister or private Christian is also mean of recovering tranquillity of mind which the disconsolate believer should not fail to employ He ought if possible to select for this purpose some holy and humble Minister or private Christian who had himself been in trouIde of mind but has mercifully been delivered from it and who appears nowto be onfinned in ith and to be filled with joy and peace in believiag He should without deky discover the condition of his soul to such one He ought to reveal to him as fully and distinctly as he can What It is that more immediately troubles and depresses his mind what it is that makes him conclude himself to be yet unregeneratc and lis former exrience to have been but counterfeit what the grounds of his present doubts and fears are and jespecially why he cannot trust in the infinitely compassionateSaviour for salvation to himself in particular Hshould if he can with prudence hint to such one the sin or sins which he apprehends have provoked the Lord to plead this controversy with him in order hat he may afford him an op portunity of speaking pertuitly to his condition When kept alencesaith David my bones waxed old througKmy roaring all the day long uis if he had said The sin which did not freely Cor vi 20 James 16 Ps xxxii ud ingenuously confess to the Lord and also to persons skilful in aswaging trouble of mind rankled inwardly and occasioned uiiqeakable anguish in my soul The affliction of the soul as well as thfyt of the body should be made known to such fellowChristian as appears qualified to suggest sutta ble advices and encouragements to the end diat these may be afforded seasonably as means of relief When the Holy Spirit comforteth dejected saint he doth it usually by the instnimentBdity ilT some other saint If the disconsolate behever be providentially favoured witii an opportunity to open the case of his soul to another believer the Holy Comforter will very seldom in an immecEate manner create peace to him He usually crtei ihefrmt of the lips peace He will comfort him by means of the presence and the speech of than whom he hath comforted and so qualified to be instruments of consolanon to him Faitbfiil Ministers of the gospel especially are helpers di ihe Christians joy But how can liiey be helpful to it in the case of disquieted Christian who stands most in needof their help if he do not aflbrd them an opportunity How can they answer objections resolve doubts or loose as one exresses jt the knots of conscience if these be not proposed to them Moreover the disccmsolate believer should not forget to request the fervent prayers not only of him to whom he has disclosed the condition df bis soul but of Qtlier Christians with whom he is uquain Spme have observed that those be Isa Ivii 19 Cor Severs in former timesy who were the most accnstomedy to request the aid of each others prajersi were commonly the most flourishing Christians Mid that those who neglected this part of their duty were usually the most languishing and hesitating If the effectual fervent prayer evea of one righteous man availcth much hoiy much more will the prayers of many such avail Finally If he would attain pure consolation be nnust not expect it from the rneansj which it Is his duty to employ Let him use diligently all the means of Divine appointment and especidUy those explained above but let him take heed that he do not trust in them nor in bis using of them for tihe smallest degree of comfort He ought to us diem as diligently as if he were to merit by it not merely spiritual consolation but even eternal life and at the same time to trust as little in tbem and in his use of them as if he had never known nor used so much as one of then His employing of them is duty which he is bound to rogard in point of performance and to renounce in point of dependance He is in his constant uae of them to rely for consolation only upon the Lord Jesus and upon Ood in Him as the God of all comfort If he would recover peacefyl serenity of mind he must renounce all confidence in his use of means and expect consolation only from his God and Saviour saying Ashur shl Qot save me neither will say any more to the work of my hands Ye are my gods What have James 16 Acts xii 12 Ps Ixii to do any more with idols He may Gxpeet aH necessary comfort in his diligent use of the iheans bit no comfort ti it He must net presume to think that his utmost diligence in em ploying them will give him either meritorioosp xsr pactional title to holy consolation Spiritual comfort is free gift gift of grace and all the appointed means of attaining it are means of grace There is indeed tendency in those means to comfort the disquieted bdiever who dUigently uses them it is not however any virtue in them nor in his use of tliem but it is the power of the Holy Spirit accompanying them that imparteth all the comfert He ought not therefore as Christians in spiritual trouble too often do to pro mise himself relief by such and such duty at this or that time or place for if his expectatioB be not answered and it would indeed be wonder if it should he will be ready to conclude that the promise of God faileth and that the disappoint ment especially if repeated is sure indication that the Lord hath cast him off for ever This instead of bringing peace or comfort to his troubled soul will contribute greatly to phmge it into still deeper perplexity and to enchain it the er under perturbation and terror Thus have endeavoured to point out the means which the disconsolate believer should chiefly employ in order to regain his spiritual comfort If he persevere in the diHgent use ef them and in complying with the advices concent ing them given in this Chapter he shall through Hos XIV grace as soon as it will subserve the glory of his 7od and Saviour and the sanctification of his owa soul recover holy consolation He perhaps may never whilst he remains in this valley of tears ex perience nqOurousjqy but he shall by the grace of the Lord Jesus recover solid tranquillity and sweet satisfaction of mind In hc of eternal life which God that cannot lie promised hefofe the world began his soul by the consoling in flaices of the Holy Comforter shall enjoy cahn and pleasing resignation in all things to the holy will of his redeeming God From the foregoing particulars it appears dearly that disconsolate saints have no allowance from the Lord Jesus to reuse to be comforted or to harden themselves in sorrow The holier any of the saints are they are when under desertion usually the more troubled The more they love their God and Saviour the more does it trouble them 4x want the light 6f his gracious countenance the more are they afraid lest they in and the more are they troubled because thy have sinned the more are they disquieted by sense of his paternal displeasure and the more are they overwhelmed by the dread of his avenging wrath Still how ever they must not yield to despondency nor harden themselves in sorrow but on the contrary they should exert themselves in usiig the means of attaining holy tranquillity of mind To peisiSt obstinately in refusing to be comforted will pro voke the Lord to proceed in the controversy and Tit yJobvi 10 feO THE MEANS OF RECOVERING to sink their

founded upon any good quality in yourself tf ipon the offer the call the ckmuttaAdtnetit believe on his name and the promise all directedy in the gospel to you as sinner of mankind These afibrd you an ample perfect suffideot warrant to believe in him and nothing in yoin self can render that warrant more complete thia it already is It is nothing within you but itii those things in the gospel without you that you all the right that you need to trust anew Jesus To say then that you have no right to intrust your salvation to him or that it would be presumption in you to trust him is direct unbsUeC Whether you believe itor not you havcia the goel full an unchangeable right to tmit as lost sinner in the almighty Saviour for aO your salvation And nothing which is good in yoursdf can afford you the

Yont warrant is that which was mentioned above YXt ignorance then of your election cannot lesMS that warrant and your knowledge of your electioO cannot add to it The offers and invitations the gospel

promises not as powerfully suggested to or impressed on your mind but as offered or directed to you in the gospel One reason perhaps of your not being favoured with comfortable impressions of promises is your not liaviqg trusted in the Holy Comforter for such impressions and your not having honoured the promises themselves by trusting them upon the Divine warrant which lies in the word without you Know then that in order to holy consolation you must study to trust Divine promises not upon the ground of their being impressed but upon that of jl being offered to you Some other disconsolate soul may be saying Alas have dead hard and deceitful heart which greatly discourages me fiom trusting that the holy One of God will ever visit me with his salvation How can hope that he will save and comfort such an uncommon sinner as am This is faithful saying and worthy of all accept tation that Christ Jesus cme into the world to save sinners of whom says our Apostle am chief Now you should accept or believe that faithful saying with application to yourselr and say It is indeed true that am an uncommon sinner yea the very chief of sinners but it is equally true that Christ Jesus came into the word to save such sinners and why notto save me My heart alas is very dead hard and deceitful butthe cleeper the depravity of it is themore Txm 15 N4 will the power and graee of Christ be glorified in Having ine from tlvat depravity will therefore venture to trust that He will glorify the exceeding riches of his grace in saving me from all the sin that dwellcth in me and from all the hiiquity that has been committed by me It is your duty to humble and to loath yourself much for the evils of your Jieart and of your life but it yonr sin to let them discourage jou in the least from altempting any one of your duties You ought indeed to be humbled for them in the greatest degree but you mtst not be deterred by tjhem even in the smallest degree from your duty especially from the first and great duty of believing in Jesas Christ If you be in your own sight the chief of aimiers even this must not discourage you ftom the chief the first of all duties The deeper yonr sense of the plague of your heart is this should instead of discouraging you excite yott the mmtj to perform diligently the duty of trusting iii Christ especially for sanctification One it may be will be saying Why should be cxhortied to trust in Christ have times whftout number been guilty of backsliding both ininy heart and in my life have frequently resolved to be more circumspect and more diligent in the spiritual performance of every duty but have upon the very slightest temptation acted contraiy to my resolutions by relapsing once and again into the same sin You have indeed much reason to exercise godly sorrow and selfabhorrence but no reason to be so dismayed as to cease trusting ai the Saviour or to be so dejected as to refuse to be comforted You bov xaiv weed to exercise re pentanoe but as much need to ercise that re liance on Christ from which true repentance flows and it is as great sin to suffer your backsliding to deter you from the latter as from the former No past sin however aggravated must be pled in excuse for omitting present duty The LfOrd hath graciously promised to keep you flpom total and final backsliding but nowhere as fiur as know to secure you against patfial bacbaliding or against relapsing in the hour of temptation into the same sins of infirmity of which you have formerly repented Abraham was suffered again and again to dissemble Lot to be twice overcome with wine John to be twice guilty of worshipping the angel and Jchosapbat lo join affinity with Ahab and afterwards to join himself with Ahaziah king of Israelj who did very wickedly It is not indeed usual with God to leave his dear children to relapse often intopioi iinous transgressions but he sufers them for their bumiliation to relapse into sins of infirmity Though your backsliding then should humble you to the dust yet it should not for moment diiseourage youfrom the great duty of trusting in Jesus Christ Hearken to these gracious these cheering invitations Return thou

sin and nsolved against it but no sooner am tempted to it than alas often fall before the temptation Indeed have much reason to dread that shall one day perish by the hands of sin and Satan Your

shall be damned if he had not been willing to give you salvation yould he ever have aaid Him that cometh to me will in no wise cast out or have complained that sinners would not come to him that they might have life if he had been unwilling to receive and save them Indeed to disbelieve his willingness is to make hima liar to say that he is not willing to save you is to blaspheme the kindness of his redeemring love and the riches of his glorious grace If you think that he is willing to save other sinnepsy but not to save you know that this is one of Satans whispers entertained by your evil heart of imbelief and that it is not more injurious to the infinitely gracious Redeemer to doubt even of his existence than to doubt of bis willingness to save lost sinnerwho desires to trust in him

of salvation or willing to quit henceforth all right to him all interest in him and to foro aH expectation fitnn him Are you then willing to bid an etemaladieu to the only Saviour and in testimony of your doing so to transcribe arid sign this Declaration do hereby in the presence of God the Judge of all declare that henceforth renouncs and that for evef all my part in the Saviour and in his salvation and that for tho fotnre will never allow myself to hope in him either for salvation or consolation Now are you indeed willing to subscribe this Renunciation If you arc not you bear false witness against yourself when you say that you are not willing to trust in Christ Jesus for salvation for your are either willing iu John ill 16 and vi 32 Rev xxii 17 John iii 33 some degree to trust

you with everlast ini destruction No it cannot be am aware that even an cmnegeoerate man will refuse in deliberate and formal manner to renoonce for ever his claim to the Saviour and yet continoe far from being willing truly to heHeven him for all his salvation But there is great difference between th refusal of tie careless dinner so to renounce Christ and that of the dlbconsolate saint The reason why the secure sinner vill refuse to abandon for ever his claim to the only Saviour is merely his fear of eternal torment whereas the reason why the disquieted saint will tremble at the thought of renouncing hjs part in him is not so much his dread of eternal torment as of being for ever separatd from the blessed God and for ever deprived of holy conformity to Him The unwillingness of the disconsolate Christian to renounce for ever his part in the great Redeemer arises from principle of grace in his heart and it implies proportional degree of willingness to trust in Him for all the parts of his salvation though the Christian be not ahle under trouble of mind to discern this willingness in himself As to the unregenerate sinner he may indeed be willing to trust in the Lord Jesus for preservation from hell but he caanot 80 long as he continues unregenerate be cordially vtiling to rely upon him for salvation from all sin and therefore let him not flatter himself that he is in the igiallest degree willing to exercise true faith peace iv believing Committing himself with all his spiritual and temporal concerns to Christ Jesus and trusting that Jesus will save him and iphold him and manage for him his soul is in proportion to the strength of his faith set at ease He rests in the Lord and waits patiently for him not only because it is his duty but because it is the instituted mean of his attaining an increase of consolation Knowing that it is the Joy of the Lord that is his strength for the iritual performance of every duty he studies to increase in Ae lively exercise of faith in order that believing he may rejoice with joy unspeakable and foil of glory Indeed faith is the principal mean not only of recovering but of increasing holy consolation The way to console is to settle the heart Tlie increase of comfort therefore will be according to the increase of faith If the believer would advance in pure ccmsolation let him endeavour diligently and constantly to exercise fidtb let him labour to enter into that rest To bring his heart to the habitual exercise of trusting simply in the Saviour will indeed cost him nuiny hard struggles and hot conflicts with his remain ing unbelief but still he must labour not only to exercise but to increase his faith and that by acting faith more frequently and by trusting in Christ at all times for an increase of it He must endeavour so to advance in the daily exercise of cordial and direct confidence in Jesus ibr salvation as thereby to receive from him daily iu Rom XV 13 Ts sxxii Pet lleb IV 11 ciease of holiness far the more of holiness he reeeives the more of holy codifort he will experience Let him also renew fiquently his applicalioh of the blood of Jesus to his conscience for purging

splied by faith coineth peace peace of conscience as well as peace with God and from peace issueth joy Hence it is evident that the way to advance in spiritual pence and joy is to increase in that faith which is relying on Christ and his righteousness for justification tmd complete salvation Moreover the principal if not tlie only way in which the Holy Comforter administers consolation to believers is hy testifying of CInist to them It is by shewing them his loveliness and love his ability and willingness to save his suitableness and faithfulness and by enabling them so to confide in him for salvation to themselves as to rejoice in the hope of that salvation It is likewise by enabling them to appropriate God in Clirist and to place increasing confidence in Him lliis was Davids

be necessary for him to be resolute in looking away irom every other object of dependance to Jesus He must habitually and peremptorily resolve to trust simply in Him and in full assurance of fiuth to intrust all his salvation and all his concerns to Hb care By thus casting bis burden upon the Lord Jesus and trusting that He will make all thingii work together for good to him his heart will be come light and cheetful he shall be freed from thousand anxieties which otherwise would disquiet and distract his soul lliemore distinct and explicit the actings of his faith are the more peace will they bring into his conscience and the more joy into his heart When his actings of faith are so lively and express that he becomes habitually eovscious of them he thereby sits down to rich feast of inward tranquillity and even of spiritual delight When his faith under the influences of the Holy Spirit is so direct und soptfticular in its exercise as to meet Christ in the promise heart to heart and eye to eye it is like rod of Myrtle in the hand of the traveller which as some say revives his spirits and enables him to proceed without feeling himself wearv He thereby dwells in him who is the Consolatios of Israel the Fountain from which all the streams of ineffable delight do flow Let every believer then study diligently to be more distinct particular and express in his exercise of faith

believing that Jesus the Consolation of Israel will qpeak comfortably to him and will never leave him comfortless and that the Holy lirit the Comforter will by His inhabitation and influence fill his soul with an increase of holy consolation and in every season of need it will be unto him according to his faith Instead of refusing to be comforted by raising captious and frivolous objections against the consolation which in the gospel is offered and promised him be should upon the warrant of the gospeloffer habitually desire and constantly rely upon Christ for higher degree of it according to the promise He ought never to forget that the comfort of the Holy Spirit is one Isft xlv 24s Zecli xiii Hos ii 14 John xiv 18 C16 THE MEANS OFINCREASnNG of the fruits of trusting in the Lord It is part of the office of faith to accept and to hand spiritual comfort to the holy soul If faith therefore be strong and frequently in exercise such soul will have strong consolation If faith increase in its habit and in the frequency of its exercise holy comfort will in proportion increase Let the believer therefore trust at all times in the Lord Jesus for increasing consolation Let him see that he take comfort rather from Christ discovered than from his own discoveries of him and that lie live comfortably upon Ghrist himsielf rather tban upon his own experience of Christ He should encourage himself continually in his God and Saviour Amidst all his inward and outward troiH blcs he must by the frequent actings of particular trust derive strong consolation from thelife ihc death

Comforter He will abide with him for ever and will bring all things to his reHacmbrance that are necessary to comfort him Believer if thou wouldst advance in true conso lation thou must always trust that whenever the Lord Jesus shall take from thee any of thy present comforts it will be only to make room for better and sweeter comforts Intrust all thy temporal comforts without the least anxiety to thy iaithful Redeemer and He will render them doubJy sweet to thee or if he shall take any of them Piov xvi 20 JoiB XIV 26 from thee he will restore them again with much advantage either in kind or in Yalue Beware of relying partly on Christ and partly on the creature for thy comfort Derive all thy comforts of every kind by the direct actings of faith from Christ in the promise and derive them

any time abound in thee thy consolation also win abound by Christ Look therefore to Jeftusj the glorious Sun of righteousness for the lighter consolation and not ta thyself andcharge it often upon thy soul to rejoice Him When thou ust diligently the appointed means of advancing in spiritual comfort do not forget to trust that he will abundantly bless them for that purposeS9 shall they prove means to thy soul of increasing in holy consolaticm If the believer would retain his comfort and rise to higher degrees of it he must exercise cori slanflji the hope ofeternal life As hope is mean of recovering so it is mean of increasing spiritual comfort The rtiore therefore that good man abounds in hope through the power of the Holy Spirit the more shall he rejoice in the hope of the glory of God Having fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before him let him sliew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope that many especially of the first Christians shewed and then he shall like them have Piiltip III Cor Rn as stroDg consolation If he hope continaally the full and endless fruition of God and of the Lamby in the heavenly world he shall thereby be weaned from undue attachment to the preset world and so shall be preserved from being much affected either by the smiles or the frowns of worldly men If he exercise daily the lively hope of that inheritance which is incorruptible tindefiled and which fadeth not away reserved ia heaven for him and build his hope upon the sure the immoveable foundation laid in Zion ranote from all the changes experienced in himself

consummate blessedness through eternity it would be special mean of exciting and promoting ifieffable delight in his soul it would fill hkheart with overflowings of holy gratitude and his lips with expressions of joy and triumph In proportion as his hope is grounded and freqnendy exercised on the love of God on the promise ef eternal life and on the righteousness gise and faithfulness of the glorious Redeemer it brings more and more of eternal life and of that heavenly delight which forms part of it into his soul That living hope is from above and in proportion as it is strengthened and

of God and all of Christ love especially the holiness the wiH and the glory of Christ Let thy soul cleave contiftually to Him and it will comfort thee greatly to think of him and of his immense and amazing love to thee To advance in suprecne love to thy dear Redeemer will notwithstanding all the afilictions which may henceforth bel thee in thy lot render thee capable of increasing in heavenly consolation Difficult things will for His sake seem easy and bitter things sweet If the believer would advance in holy conso lation let him in the faith of redeeming love to him learn to deligJu more and more in the ktw of the Lord The more he is enabled to delight in the iU of God expressed in that holy law the more comfortable and happy is he in doing that will the more pleasure does he take in performing every part of his duty and seeing he is commanded to employ himself aura in present duty the more his present duty is his delight the more will he always be delighted Great peace salth the Psalmist have they who love thy law and nothing shall oiBTend them For the more they delight in the holiness spirituality and perfection of the law as the rule of their duty and in holy obedience to it the clearer evidence they have that they are so justified byaith as to have peace with God the more do they enjoy peaoe of conjscience which is sense of peace with God and Ps cxik Pt cxix 16S ih more are they at peace with the creatures of God No external troubles or offencesy can deprive them of this great peace or divert them from the path of dutj in which they delight Indeed the more holy man delights in the commandments of the law as expressions of the will of God the Father who loveth him of the mind of Christ who redeeroeth him and of the desire of the Holy Spirit who dwelteth in him the more will he regard sincere obedience to them as his privilege his pleasure and his comfort Those precepts which are all holy and just and good prescribe good nd pleasant work to him such work as is not only good for him but agreeable to the bent of his renewed nature Tlie more therefore he advances in sanctification the more pleasure doth he take in doing and even in suffer iug the will of his heavenlyFather So much was this the attainment of the holy apostle Paul ttat he gloried in tribulations that he took pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities ill persecutions in distresses for Christs sake because it was tha will of God that he should endure them and because they aSoried the jpower of Christ an opportunity so to rest upon him as to be gloriously displayed and evidenced to be per feet in his weakness Doubdess his taking pleapsure even in manifcdd sufferings for the sake of Christ could not but be attended with such measure of holy consolation as would make him exceeding Joyful in all his tribulation Thus it is evident that the more believer delights in the Cor xii 10 Cor vii providential and especially in the preceptive will cGod and the more spiritual and exact his obedience is the more experience has he of spiritual comfort Besides his delighting in or savouring those things of the Spiiit is comfortable evidence to him not onlythat he hath the Spirit of Christ and that the prevailing inclination of his heart is toward spiritual and holy objects but that the delight which he has rn the Lorcl and in the word and law of the Lord is his chief ddight how cheering must it be to holy nmiiy to be conscioiS not only that the grace of the promises but that the holiness of the precepts instead of displeasing him renders them inexpressibly pleasant to his soul He cannot perish in his affliction bts cause the law of God is his delight Delight in the will of the Lord is heaven upon efarth the very essence of real satisfaction of itm fyicit The Iord himself is inconceivablyliappy in his own will and he hath rewaled it tohfs people that they might be happy in it likewise Another mean of retaining and increasing spiritual comfort is frequently to exercise goity sofTOWyOr coniriiiotiofhearfj for sin Tobe oitttrite in heart is from principle of fiiith inChrist of love to God and of desire to please and honour him to be sorrowful for having sinned against him The apostle Paul styleth sorrow for sin god sorrow that is sorrow which hath God in Christ for its authm and its object or sorrowybr God for having by sin offended God of

to his holy will or sorrow which is accepiable to God through Jesus Chrit The same apostle informs us that it worketh repentance wnto salvation that evangelical repentance which is mans turning from all sin to God as in Christ God of infinite mercy and grace Now in order to advance in holy consolation the Christian must in the faith of pardoning mercy and of sanctifying grace exercise frequently that godly sorrow for sin especially for tlo sin that dwelloth in him The exercise of godly sorrow is not only consistent with holy joy but it always tends to it and frequently issues in it yea it even includes Such refrsliing of soul such joy of heart is often experienced in the depth of godly sorrow that the true penitent would not exchange even the lowest degree of that joy for all the carnal mirth in the world The most sorrowful Christian would not for thousand worlds exchange states or pleasures with the most prosperous of ungodly men In eomparison that pure and solid joy with which the penitential sorrow of true belierr is often attended caraal mirtli is folly and even madneL His mourning for sin because it hath offended his giacious God and wounded his compassionate Saviour because it hath pierced that heart which loveth him and shed that blood which saveth him is joyful mourning real comfort to his souL To mourn for sin cles ii on such accounts as these Is as one expresses it to weep for joy As godly sorrow cannot be exercised by the Christian without some comfortable apprehension ofthe mercy of God to him or of Christs having been pierced for is iniquities so it is seldom exercised by him without some do groa of comfort ejperienced cither in or after his exercise of it Wisdoms ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace The believing penitent takes delight in mourning for his crucified Redeemer in sitting down at his pierced feet and bathing tliem with his tears His godly sorrow is mean both of preparing him for consolation nd of introducing it into liis soul Accordingly Jehovali promiseth that He will dwd with him who is of contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of tlie humble and to revive the heart of tlie contrite ones The Lord Jesus also saith IMessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted and again The Lord hath anointed iDeto bind up the brokenhearted to comfort all that mourn Hence holy fasting is represented in Scripture as spiritual feasting The penitential grief of holy man is also matter of joy to him He rejoices more to feel his heart melting for sin than he would do in enjoying all the carnal delights of the sons of men He finds secret sweetness in the tears of evangelical repentance balm which refreshes and cheers his soul Besides godly sorrow renders him capable of receiving in higher degree in Prov Ill 17 Isa Ivii 15 Malth Imu Ixi Zcch viii 19 IN SPIRITUAL COMFORT S27 floences of holy consolation The more he grievesin godly manner for sin the more capable is he of rejoicing in God his Saviour yea the more he grieves that he cannot as he ought grieve for his iniquity and mourns that he cannot mourn the more capacity has he for receiving and enjoying spiritual comfort The foy of Gods salvation is not to be found but in die deep recesses of contrite heart Although then true repentance consists more in turning from all sin to God than merely in sorrow for sin yet in order to retain and Increase his comfort for the service and the glory of God the believer should diligently exercise that sorrow It will be necessary for the same purpose that he be more and more diligent in mortifying the sin that dwelleth in him When the Christian finds himself yielding to motions of sn in his heart it cannot but occasion to him trouble of soul but when he feels himself by the sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit enabled to resist or act against them it is special comfort to him and the more he is enabled to maintain holy opposition to them the more pure and solid is hi consolation To mortify the deeds of the body of sin and the members of it which are upon the earth isconstantly to apply the blood and the Spirit of Christ for subduing weakening and destroying it with all its corrupt affections principles and practices it is by the gracious inflaencesofthe Spirit of Christ so to resist and to subdue the vital qualities and active powers of the botly of sin in ihe heart as gradually tb des troy them Now one of the means which the believer must employ in order to retain and increase his comfort is to maintain constantly holy opposition to all the affections principles and motions of the body of sin in him until in conformity to Christ in his crucifixion and by grxrcc derived from his fulness they be destroyed The more resolute he is and the more pleasure be takes in thus mortifying them the more of spiritual and pure consolalion will he attain The more of sanctilying influences he derive by faidi for the mortification of sin the more of consoling influences will le commonly receive Accordingly David prayed thus Create in me cleau heart God renew in mfe right spirit apdthen Restore to me thejc of thy salyalioB As the Christ inn advances in mortifying hi unbelief and pride his selfrighteous and vpldly spirit he will increase his enjoyment of the clieedng light of his heavenly Fathers countenance The more diligent and successfid he is in mortifying his propensity to cavil or dispute against the freeness of the offers promises and grace of the gospel the more disposed he will be to admit and to relish the comfoits of the gospel It is in proportion as remaining sin dies in the believer that he lives life of holiness and of comfort The weaker the body of sin in him is the less power over him will his other spiritual enemies have the temptations of Satan and of the world will proportionably lose their influence with him The only care of the hypocrite is to reform his life whereas the main though not the only concern of the sincere believer is to cleanse his kear And the sweetness which he experiences in obtaining victory over sin in his heart is thousand times greater than the seeming pleasure which is felt in gratiing sin Indeed were the least real pleasure to be enjoyed in sinning the torments of the damned in hell would thereby be grealtly lessened for there they will for ever sin in the utmost degree possible but instead of being the less they sliall be the more tormented as well as for their sirniing Believer take heed that thou be dilijgent in mortifying the depiavity of thy heart The further thou advancest in mortifying the sin that remains in thee and especially the sin that more easily besets thee the more pleasure wilt thou tekcy in mortifying it and the more comfort wik thou experience in thy conflicts with it Learn to hate all sin in an ifiireasihg degree for the mor thou abhorrest it the greater delight thou wilt take in opposing and subduing it Holy joy can consist with remaining sin but not with retained abd indulged sin Mortify then through the Spirit the corruption of thy nature and Christ will not be constrained to mortify it for thee by the extremity of outward or of inward trouble Study to attain more eminence in that grace which is the direct opposite of the sin which doth easily beset thee Jer iv 14 Lullier used to say fear more what is Within me than what comes from without the storms and winds without do never move the earth it only vapoui8 within that cause earthnakcs S30 THE MEANS OF INCREASING The Christian must for the same enJ endeavour daily to become more and more circumspect and conscienthttSy in the practice of universal holi ness It is only in proportion as he walketh inthe fear of the Lord that he can walk in the t5omfort of the Holy Spirit To walk circumspectly is to be habitually cautious and watchful on every side against all manner of sin and to be always attentive to every duty and eytj cir cumstance of duty or it is to walk in all tbe duties of holiness with wisdom diligence and ex actness So far as good man walketh circumspectXjy he is in all thingsuprit exacts andccm scientious He is in the fear of the Lord all theday long From princijde of faith in Christy and of love to God he dreads sin as the worst evil in the world and consequently he abstains evoft from all appearance of that evil He abstains from the very appearance of not mesely be cause he sees that it is reasonable and prudent to do so but because it is the will of his God and Father And though this doth not afford him the smallest title to Divine consolation yet lie kndws that it is necessary mean of it and that it is inseparably connected with as much of it as the Lord seeth good ta afford him The more spiritually and closely he walks with God the more doth he walk in the light of his countenance The more he makes the practice of universal holiness his main business business in which be principally engages and which he pursues with the greatest earnestness and diligence the clearer evir Acts ix 31 ProY xxiii UThess 2a dence has he that the Holy Spirit the Ccmiforter dwelleth in him Accordingly the Lord Jesus said to his disciples If ye love me keep my commandments and will pray the Father and be shall give you another Comforter that he may abide with you for ever Let the believer then beware of sinning especially of sinning wilfully for that would provoke the Lord to cover his evi dences with cloud in his anger and to suspend influences of consolation from his souL Let it be his constant purpose and unwearied endeavour through grace to please God in every thing and to displease Him in nothing To walk circumspect ly is indeed the sure way to walk comfortably and to advance in comfort He who is enabled from the principles of ith and love and for the glory of God so to walk shall sing in the righteous ways of the Lord for he shall find that they are ways of pleasantness and paths of peace Aa holy comfort is necesarv to the practice of holiness so increasing holiness of heart and of life is requisite to the maintenance and increase of comfort As heat accompanies fire so greater or lesa measure of comfort usually attends the spiritual performance of holy actions It cannot be otherwise For to walk circumspectly in course of holy obedience is to walk with God the God all comfort t9 walk in Christ the Consolation oB Israel and to walk after the Spirit the Holy Comforter If the believer would walk so circumspectly as to glorify Christ and to promote his own comfort John xiv 1516 Fs cxxxViii Fsxix 11 he must first tflke heed that he do not on any occasion walk ill the darky that he do not go forward where he cannot by the light of holy Scripture discern his way and next he should be as much aaid of taking comfort merely from his duties themselves us from his sins To grow in spiritual mindcclness is also die way to maintain and increase spiritual comfort To be spiritually minded is from the spiritual principles of grace and under the sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit to have the mind and heart frequently intently and delightfully eraployed about spiritual objects It is to have all the powers of the soul habitually concurring ia spiritual thoughts and desires and in taking holy complacence in the things of the Spirit especially in the things concerning Christ and the wmiderful scheme of redemption by him Now one special mean of advancing in spiritual consolation is to increase in spiritu mindedness The apostle Paul informs us that to be spiritually minded is life and peace It is in its very nature spiritual life and is the earnestand the beginning of life eternal consisting in the full and itnmediate fruition of God and the Lamb in the mansions of glory and in proportion as the believer increases in it his soul is endued not only with spiritual activity but with pleasing serenity and pure consolation Tlie more spiritually minded he become the more of spiritualflr and comfort he attains The more he spiritually understands metlitates relishes and delights in the doctrine of redeeming grace and tlie glory of God displayed in the won Rom VVv dcrful person and work of the great Redeemer tlie more of pleasing tranquillity and of refreshing delight does he experience By how much he grows in spiritual understanding or in the knowledge of the transcendent loveliness and love of God in Christ and of the excellence suitableness and freeness of salvation by Christ by so much does he experience holy serenity and solid consolation in committing to such God and such Saviour all his spiritual and tenqioral concerns In proportion as his heart becomes more deeply sensible of the unparalleled holiness and beauty of spiritual objects and of his own personal interest ki them it is delighted enlarged and elevated Whether4ie contemplates the cheering truths and precious promises of the gospel or practises the spiritual duties of the law toward his God or his nchbour tle inor spiritual he is in them the more pure 6lidJid heavenly is the pleasure which li6 enjoyii lhese are the banquet of his mind They are sweeter than honey to his taste In proportion ais Ms spirituaj iinderstanding and bis disposition to coflnt all earthly things empty and mearij in comparison of union with Christ and 4f xDformity to Him increase he sets his affection on things above he places his happiness in them and rejoices in hope of them When he advances in habitual desires and in holy endeavours to aim in all his exercise of graces and performance of duties at the glory of his God and Redeemer he in the same proportion glories and delights in the Loird To become more and more spiritually minded then is sure way of attaining higher degrees of spiritual comfort As dil5 bird ilies the more out of danger he is from the snares of the fowler so the higher believer soars in spirituality of mind above the virorkl the higher and the safer is his consolation Moreover the Christian in order to attain increasing comfort must be always on his guard gainst formality and remissness in his exercise of graces and performance of duties To be remiss or formal in performing any of his duties is th very opposite of being spiritually minded Now he may assure himself that he is declining into formalityif he be more studious of approving himself to men than to God if instead of performing his duties with hoi delight he perform them as task if instead of habitually exercising faith love godly sorrow and spiritual desire in performing them he satisfy himself with the external performance and if the remaining carnality of his mind be not so grievous or burdensome to him as formerly Nothing will more effectually hinder his advancing in the comfort of the Holy Spirit than remissness or negligence of spirit in the duties of religion For when the Christian does not serve God with his spirit he grieves the Holy Spirit of God and provokes Him to suspend influences of consolation from his soul and when he does not ardently pursue increasing comniunion with Christ in holy exercises he cannot expect to enjoy the comfmt of communion with him 10 Another mean of believers advancing in pirital comfort is to become more and more con Songv Prov Heni mth God in Christy as his inheritance He cannot be comfortable but in proportion as he is content God in Christ as their CovenantGod is the sure the boundless the unchanging and the everlasting portion of all the saints Nothing can he added to Him nothing can be taken from him diminished in him holy man may lose all his earthly possessions but he cannot lose bis God nor any thing in God and therefore he continues still as rich as he was before His outward comforts are only lent him in order to be 4ased for season and then to be willingly and thankfully restored but his God is given him to be eternally enjoyed by him as his immense unchangeable and sure portion and therefore he has as muth reason to be satisfied with and to xejoice in his allsufficient inheritance after as before his outward losses The ancient Church accordingly after she liad been deprived of her best external comforts placed her happiness and her hope in Jehovah as her sure portion The Lord js tny portion saith my soul therefore will hope in him And Asaph when he was emerging from iiis depths of spiritual trouble said to Jehovah Whom have in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that desire besides thee My flesh and my heart faileth but God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever The sincere believer trusting that gracious God bestoweth Himself and all that he is and that he liath upon him as his infinite inheritance should be much more content than he is with his por Lam ill 24 PsIxxiii 25 26 tion Tlie more satisfied he is with God in Christy tis his inheritance the more pleasure will he take in him and the more pleasure lie taketh in him the more consolation will he receive from him wai the more will he rejoice in him Although the firtiee shall not blossom saith Habakkuk neither shall fruit be in the vines yet will rejoice in the Lord will joy in the God of my salvation In prcrtion as the believer is content with God or satisfied that his CovenantGod is enough for Irim without any thing else except what infinite wisdom and love see meet for time to afford hrni he attains true lasting and increasing enjoyment If he have outward comforts he enjoys God in them or if he have bcea xleprived of tlicm he still enjoys them in God that his spiritual eiijoymcnt or comfort is not fitrictly speaking depcndeiit on them Being satis fied with God himself as his portion he learns to be content with all the providential dispensations ofGod have learned says Paul in whatsoever state am therewith to be content The Lord Jesus hafth given to his Church exceeding great andprecious promises in order that every saint may by faith suck and be satisfied With these breasts of her tronsolation andGod having reconciled them to himself in him hath graciously promised that He mil be tieir God what cause then hath the believer to be always content He is an heir of God and joint heir with Christ and therefore aU Hab ilr 17 IS Philip Iv 11 15 Isa Ixvi II fs are his

to the will of the Lord He must endea vour by grace not only to be content with God in Christ as his infinite portion but to increase in holy resignation of heart to the will of God with respect to all his earthly comforts The way to advance in peaceful tranquillity of soul is to become so resigned to the providential will of the Lord as always to submit without murmuring to that holy will Gods will of providence as well as his will of precept is not only wise and sovereign but holy and just and good It is infinitely wise9 and therefore it cannot be lialde to the smallest mistake in its deternination of any thii re qecting the external condition of the believer It is absolutely sovereign and therefore it is invain fi him to attempt resistance to it is also infinitely holy and righteous and for these reasons it is infinitely incapable of doing Christian the smallest iujury or of dispensing to him any thing whether pleasant or painful but what is right and even necessary for him It is infinitdy good j3s rise and thcnrefore it can appoint nothing to hap3en in the putward condition of believer but pihat is good yea best for subserving at the time he sanctification and consolation of his sbnl So TQod is the will of the Lord that it hath deternined never to give nor to take away single mtward comfort from saint but when this is rood for jiim or even necessary to pronote the rreat designs of redeeming grace in bis salvation wise and good is that adorable will that all hings do under the direction and control of it work together for good to them who love God them who are the called according to his purrose If therefore holy man would advance pure consolation he must study in dependance the grace of Christ cordially to resign himself md all his concerns to the holy will of his heaenly Father The more he studies to delight in he holy will of God the more will he be disposed acquiesce in it and the more he acquiesces it the more of comfort amidst all the vicisi odes of life shall he experience Let him endea our to love it in an increasing degree for in proportion as he loves it he will be pleased with and will rejoice to think that every thing iu rs lot has been from eternity unalterably fixed 4ording to it He will delight in the cheering bought that under the direction and control of all objects all events do either directly or in lirectly promote his eternal welfare and that all rands in the universe are contimially at work for pod to him If affliction come Jthe storm which Bom viil 28 P2 t40 THE MEANS OF INCREASIKa tlien arises in his natural passions is hushed into calm and not only doth submission but sweet resignation ensue So far as the believer attains holy resignatioDi he is secure from disappointment for his leading de sire that the will of the Lord may be done conxerning him cannot fail to be accomplished He believes that the Lord chooseth better for him than he can do for himself He is persuaded not only that he hath no rights to complain of any providential dispensation but thnt he hath no teason because all the paths of the Lord are mercy and trutli to him was dumb says holy David opened not my mouth because thoii didst it In proportion as he is resigned to the holy will of God he is always pleased always comfortable because whatever pleaseth God pleases him As far as his will is in union with the will of the Lord he shall always have what he chooses he shall constantly be in state of enjoyment as having the yry thing which he desires If he be under affliction Jhe comforts himself with thinking that it is the appointment of his heavenly Fathers wili Believer the more thou wcomest the whole will of thy gracious God and Father the Hiore happi ness and comfort shalt thou enjoy Consider hov unbecoming how sihful it is to murmur against the will of the onlywise God thy Saviour Know that tle momeit thou repinest at the providence of the Lord thou seretly accusest him thou presumest to charge Him with having done thee as injury to blanie him for something wrong in his Ps XXV 10 Ps xxxix ft Bxiagbmeui of thy affairs Biit is not this tlie same as secretly to blaspheme him if thou ipvouldst maintain spiritual consolation take heed ihat thoUniuinnur not against the holy will of thy gracious God Thou art not qualified to be the chooser of thy ownoutwaid condition and therefojpe it belongeth not to thy wisdom and will bu to His to dispose of all thy affairs 12 Another mean of advancing itiHoly coiio lationv is to become more and mure thankful for hiesjiugs either received or promised To give thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Ghri jbboth the duty andthe privilege of aholy man It is his dutyj in every condition of life to maintain thankful frame of hearty and to express daily to the Lord lively and grateful sense of the unmerited and unnumbeilsd benefib whith He hatli bestowed upon him The apostle Paul ac cordingly gave this charge to the Thessalonians In every thing give thanks for this is the will of God in Ghrist Jesus concerning you And in his Epistle to the Hebrews he says By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name It is also bl privilege to the believer when he is enabled in every circumstance of life to be thankful for the mercies which God bestoweth either upon himself or others disposition to be in every condition tliankful to the Lord for benefits received from him is always attended with some degree of comfort in st 20 TIic9 18 Heb xiiL IS P3 holy soul saints frequent recpllection and acknowleiTgment of the sweet merci which he ha in handy and of the sure mercies which he has in hope tend to sweeten and to cheer his spirit Praise and thanksgivings acrding the foUowing passages of Scripture are the genuine expressions of comfortable frame of soul My heart greatly rejoiceth and with my song will praise him Because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee My mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips My lips sball greatly rejoice when sing unto thee and my soul which thou hast redeemed While these passages evince praise and thanksgiving to le the native expressions of holy joy they at tho same time intimate that sainCs being disposed gratefully to praise and thank the Lord for bl ings either received or promised is commoal attended with an increase of comfort or joy Aa habitual cheerfulness of spirit is thereby maintainodand increased ieart truly thankful is in the same proportion cheerful The most humble and tliankful of the saints aie commonly the most ciminent in holiness and comfort Indeed thank fuhleis and comfort imply each other holy man ipust be in some degree comfortable in order to be thankful and thankful in order to be in an increasing degree comfortable If then he would retain and increase his holy consolation let him frequently give thanks to God not only for ths unspeakable gift of his dear Son but for all his benefits conferred upon him let bii aa often and xsvlii Ps Ixlii Ps Ixxi 23 as much as possible gratefully remember them and thank the Lord for each of them whether it be great or smaU spiritual or temporal blessing He must be thankful particularly for the degree of comfort with which the Lord hath already favoured him and then if his trials or suf ferings do at any time abound his consolation by Christ will also abound Let him extract arguments even from the darkest dispensations of providence for exciting him to be alvoays thank fill to his God and Redeemer for when he is oontinually thankful he will in the same proiXrtion be comfortable He should moreover ex press his gratitude daily for the inestimable and innumerable blessings vouchsafed to him by giving to God in Christall the glory of thera and by Employing them all for the purposes of his glory so shall he enjoy them and experience increasing comlbrt in using them If Further Let the believer jraywith increasing importunitybr tkeconlinuance and increase al his holy comlbrt The fervent and incessant prayer of faith is mean not only of recovering but of retaining and increasing spiritual consolation Let him therefoie pray iinportunately not only for sanctifying hutfor consoling influences The Spirit is the Comforter of the saints and God giveth the Holy Spirit to them who ask him The Christian then should with increasing earnestness pray to his heavenly Father ia the name of Christ and in the faith of the promise for the refreshing and comforting grace of the blessed 2Xor Lukexi 13 Pi Spirit The more earnestly and frequently he offers up the prayer of faith for grace and conisolation the more will his heart be strengthened with the consolation of the Holy Comfovter In the day when cried saith David thouansweredst me and strenglenedst me with strength in my soul When the God eonsoIadoD seeroeth at any time to be forgetting or passing by the exercised believer the prayer of faith will call him in When the Lord Jesus having comt to Emmaus made as though he would have gcrne further and when the two disciples eonstraioed him saying Abide with for it is towards evening and the day is far spent He went in to tarry with them TTie less true Christians desire from Christ the less do they glorify the immense riches of his grace but on the contraiyi the more they expect and the more they ask from him the more will he give and the more will he manifest his delight in giving to them The believer therefore should pray as the apostle Paid did for the saints at Rome That the God of hope would fill him with all joy and peace in believing and as the same apostle prayed for the Thessalonians That the Lord Jesus Christ himself and God even his Father would contfort hb heart and establish him in every good word and work And he should pray as the disciples did That the Lord would increase his feith for as faith is increased so is the joy of faiths Let him Ps cxxxviii Xuke xxiy 28 29 Kqoi XV 13 Thess ii 16 17 pray that he may be enabled always to thirst for spiritual consolation as the hart tbirsteth for the waterbrooks and at the same time let his desire of sensible comfort be regulated by due submission to the sovereign will of God Paul had not been long praying before it was revealed to him that he was chosen vessel It was when Jesus Christ himself was praying that He was transfigured and that voice from the excellent glory said This is my beloved So in whom am well pleased Those of thesaints who pray most have the most comfort Prayer crowneth God with the glory of his redeeming grace and God erowneth prayer with the comlbrt of thai grace If holy man would so pray as thereby to advance in spiritual comfort he must not only pray in th and with importunity but he must pray with his spirit with understanding with sincere desire of that which he asketh with watchfulness Mtention and ardour He should make supplication to God as his GodaBd Father in the name of Christ by the help of the Spirit and only for things which are promised Se ought always to pray and hot tp fiint or to continue instant in prayer It will be secessary alsp that he plead in praver that he pleaid the promises and that he fill nfs raoulh with such argument as will tend toexcite and iiiicrease his faith and hpp6 and Iove He must moreover be habitually disposed to pray to interniingle ejaeulatory prayer with all his othet dudes and to pray much in secret ft was whenu Jacob retired for secret prayer that the Atigl ofi Loke xviii Bom ii 12 P6 the covenant came to hia and enabled him so to wrestle with Him by supplication as to receive the blessing She who was alone with Jesus at the sepulchre was the first who participated in the joy of his resurrection The holy Psalmist seems to have considered the comfort which he enjoyed with God in secret as his sweetest comfort 14 It is necessary for the same purpose that the believer mcrease daily in his knowledge qf Hm grounds of spiritual consolation JHe must in prder to advance in true comfort study through grace to attain clearer and juster views of God the

reports of sense By sense here ie meant the present frames or feeling or pereeption of an exercised Christian which is either pleasant or unpleasant and is contimiaily sfibjeet to ebange To hearken and trust to the reports of sense or in other words to make his feelings or frames the ground of his faith or the rule according to which he regulates his exercise renders the feith of the Christian unsteady and hinders the growth of it and if the growth of faith be obstructed the increase of spiiitu comfort will be obstructed likewise Sense judges and reports that he is in state of grace and that Christ saveth him liierely because his feelings are pfeasant and comfortable It concludes that his state is either good or bad only from what hejeelsj or from his present frame of spirit If this

dou4ting Sense also looks at the fi uits of faith more than at the object of it and if the believer has been iiisled and taught to confound these two together he will be at great uncertainty in judging of his state for instead of making the word of God he will make his comforts the ground of his faith and as these are more or less so will his faith be When he has comfortable feelings then he will think himself believer and when lie has none then he will think himself an unbeliever changing his judgment of himself as his feelings do like the wind anc varyingas his comforts do like the weather This is common case have seen the sad effects of it in the lives of many of my ifDaaiiitance who from being taught thus to judge of theiQ8elve9y were tost about for several years np arid down nhw comforted then doubting and could not get aoj sqIM eaEtaUisliiQittt till Uis yrqril aud Birit Coi 16 It will be necessary also for the same purpose that the believer be always upon his guar against affected sadness Has Jie already some happy measure of trueconsolation Let him shew that he has it by an habitual cheerfulness of temper and of manner Let him not by assuming an air of gloominess or peevishness shew to any around him that he finds no comfort in life of communion with the blessed Redeemer WhcH believer is not afflicted with trouble of soul and yet appears habitually dejected and gloomy he thereby in the view of others gives the lie to the truth of his holy profession as well as to the truth of God in his promises of consolation convinced them tbat sense was not to be the ground of their believing nor the object to whicli they were to look Sense judges by feeling and reports what it see Sense says Now am in the favour of God for feel Now he is my God for find him so an comforted Now he demonstrates it to me for feel nearness to birh in prayer and sweet answers Now am sure imy duties and services are acceptable for am quite lively in them find come from them with warm affections Now canmt doubt for feel the assurance of his love to me And when sense has lost those comfortable feelings then it draws contrary inferencesNow am not in the favotir of God for do Hot feel it Now he is not my God for do not find faim so am not comforted What can be the issue of this but continual wavering and changing For our feelings are sometimes more sometimes less as every believer experiences What state then must be be in who has no way to judge of himself but by those cbangele thiDg What room does he leave for continual 49ubtiBg and what trouble and misery does he thereby bring upon himself as well as dishonour to the imchaugeableness of God in his pature and promises He thereby practically declares it to be false that God is the God of all comfort that the Lord Jesus the Consolation of Israel that the Holy Spirit is the Comforter ftnd that wisdoms ways are ways of pleasantness By assuming an air of glpojniness or of peerishness he instead of recommending the way of hoKness brings reproach upiai that good way Like the unbelieving spies who by bringing np an eil report of the promised land discouraged the Israelites he represents the life of faith and holiness as an uncomfortable an unamiable life and so discourages more effectually than one can express sinners around bim from tring to enter upon that life Were he on the contrary by an habitual cheerfulness of temper and manner to exhibit the comforts of religion so faf as he possesses them he would reseible the iithful spies who brought with them dusters of the grapes of Canaan that they might thereby iavit their brethren to enter lliat good land jLt is bis duty as be is infinitely obliged to the Lord Jesus to promote always the honour oChii glorious xamcy Mid the interests of his ritual kingdom taaoxg men His whole behaviour Uirifore should such as would be the means of wjUuiingsoi to the blessed Redeemer The apostle Peter exhorteth wives to be in subjection to their own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives holy manshould not only be but appear to be habitually cheerful that all who know hini might have an opportunity of perceivings that Pet ill his blessed Sayiour hadi made him luippy as well as holy and that his holy religion instead of haying rendered him gloonq hath disposed him to be cheerfbl Ccmsdousy that he is under the greatest obligations to invite oUiers around bimto taste and see that the Lord is good let him henceforth adopt this resolution of the holy Psalmist My soul shall make her boast in the Lord the humble shall hear thereof and be glad He has cause indeed to be always humble and penitent but no cause to appear gloomy smiling aspect is eomelj and doubdess none have so good reason to be of cheerful countenance as the upright in heart If the believer then would have lasting and increasing comfort let him be continually upon his guard against affected or pretended sadness else he wiU provoke the Lord to deprive him of his present degree of comfort and to afflict him with real sadness Although he does not always enjoy sisible consolation yet he has the root and the habit of it and has always good cause to rejoices Let him therefore be always cheerful and on every occasion shew that he can distinguish between gravity and sullenness seriousness and gloominess and let hkn never appear so ignorant as once to insinuate it to be right or becoming in any true Christian to fpear habitunlly sad and sullen 17 If the believer would attain increasing tranquillity of mind he must frequenib examine hisheavi and conduct in order that be may the more clearly discern his evidences of personal interest in iritual consolation The more clearly he per Pa XXX Iw peives his personal interest in Christ and in the covenant of grace the higher will the degree of his holy comfort usually be ITie more digent ly he scrutinizes his heart and life comparing diem with the word of God and the more fjre queiitly and clearly he perceives in consequence of the witnessing of the Holy Spirit his evidences of union and communion with Christ the more will his heart be comforted and encouraged the more will he know that he is of the truth and with the greater confidence will he assure his heart before God Now when he has it in view at any time to examine himself let him begin it by renewing his act of trusting in Christ for all his salvation as well as for the joy of that salvation For if be begin this inquiry by doubting tliat the Lord Jesus will not save him or by yielding to distrust and despondency he will be afraid to search deeply into liis heart or to know the worst of himself But if he begin it by an act of htimble and direct confidence in Christ Jesus for salvation to himself in particular he will be disposed as well as encouraged to deal impartially with himself he will be willing to find out the worst as well as the best himself He will not be afraid to find that his heart so far as it is unrenewed is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked Besides by means of that acting of faith his other graces will be invigorated and excited to lively exercise and the more he exercises them the more easih and the more clearly will he perceive them Further Jet him begin it also by praying that the Holy JoUiv 1Q Spirit may shine upon the graces which he trusts are implanted in his heart and so bear wit ness with his ovih spirit that he is child of God He may then proceed to try his graces and he should try them by their nature rather than by the degree of their strength or liveliness Let him more especially examine himself whe ther he be in ihefaithj and so prove himself If he do not discern jtrue faith in his heart yet if he conscious of an earnest desire to believe cordial in Jesus Christ accompanied by frequent en deavours to do so he ought to conclude that he hath some measure of that precious faith An ear nest and habitual desire of grace is grace in the account of God and mans desire of faith of love of hope and of all the other graces of the Spirit is sincere and earnest when he desires them for their own intrinsic excellence and amiableness and chiefly for the glory of God in Christ md when though he do not perceive them he yet feels his need of them and is conscious that he desires them and desires even the perfection of them Let the believer then trusting that the Lord Jesus giveth him grace and that the holy Comforter will in every time of need shine upon that grace in his soul and render it apparent to himj enter frequently upon the trial of his state and conduct and if he find but one scriptural evidence of his being in state of grace he ought for his comfort to conclude that he has all the other evidences of being in it though he cannot at present clearly perceive them Nevertheless he Rom viii 16 Cor xiii Matth should frequently pursue the important inquiry till he have the comfort of discerning clearly all his evidences for the move knqwledge he has of his personal interest in the blessings of salvatioD die more consolation he will enjoy Moreover let the bdiiever search daily into his heaFt and life in order to find out more of his sins and of his wants that by deep and aSbcting sense of them he may be urged to apply and plead frequently the promises of pardon and of sanctifies lion This is necessary mean of walking in the comfort of the Holy Spirit 18 Finally In order to advance in spiritual consolation the believer must endeavour diligently to mortify hisear of death Altlough death is by the dimighty Redeemer so disarmed of its sting and strength that it can do no hurt to any of his redeemed yet it is still dreadfiil enemy to nature When the exercised Christian thinks of temporal death as armed with the tremendous curse of the violated law and as punishment of sin it assumes even to him the grim and ghastly visage of the king of terrors But when he contemplates it as removed from the mrse of the covenant of works to the promise of the covenant of grace as no longer curse but blessing and as no more an enemy but friend to all the spiritual seed of Christ its terror should not make him afraid Tlie apostle Paul said to the believers at Corinth Death is yotirsJ And concerning himself he saith To me to live is Christ and to die is gain John the beloved disciple heard voice MGoriiL22 fi PhiUpL21 from heaven saying unto bira Write Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord If temporal death then is an article in the inventory of the believers treasure and if as such it is his in pro mise if it is gain to hini and blessing in dis guise why should he any longer fear it with slavish dread why should he suffer himself so to fear it as for single moment to lose the smallest degree of his holy consolation If good man therefore would subdue and rise superior to his fear of death let him under the sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit studj 1st To fear sin more and more As one wedge drives outanotherj so the godly fear of sinning expels the slavish fear of dying 2d Let him also in the prospect of dying commit frequently his soul with all the concerns of it to his infinitely merciful and faithful Redeemer and let him commit it with unsuspecting confidence to Him trusting firmly that as he is able so he is willing to keep that which he hath committed to him against the great day Let him constantly intrust to the Lord Jesus the safety the comfort and the complete salvation of his precious soul and as often as disquieting fear arises let him sky with the holy Psalmist What time aiti afraid tvili trust in thee None who trust in Him shall be desolate Seeing the great Redeemer who liveth for evermore and who hath the keys of hell and of death iavitetby and even commandeth the saints to trust him with their souls their bodies and all tlieir concerns they may rest assured that he will not deceive Rev xT 13 Ps Ivi Ps xxxiv 22 their expectation no he will not deceive it for he hath promised that he will never leave them nor forsake them 3d The Believer should for the same purpose familiarize to his mind the tbonghts of dying and of his Redeemers glorious victory over death and the grave He OHgfat to meditate frequently on Christs having as his fe deral representative disarmed death to the dying Christian The almighty Redeemer hath disarmed it of its sting and strength and so of all its terror The sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law Now the Lord Jesus hath put away sin by the sacrifice of him self and he hath perfectly fulfilled the 2a8 by his obedience unto death Thus he hath for the true believer disarmed death of its venomous sting and at the same time of its strength or dreadful dominion And what hurt can the most poisonous and frightful monster do to him when it has entirely lost both its sting and its strength The Redeemer promiseth that by taking away the sting and the strength of it he will be the plague of death to his dting saints Nay he promiscdi that by raising them up in glory at the last day he will be the destructiofi of death to his deadXLinXs will ransom them saith he from the power of the grave will redeem them fixm death death will be thy plagues grave will be thy destruction repentance shall be hid from mine eyes Accordingly we read that he hath abolished death that is he hath annulled or re Heb xiii Cor xv 5Q Hos xiii 14 Tim 10 uced it to nothing or so destroyed it to all who believe in hinif as to have turned it from curse to blessing How consoling then how cheering is the thought that death disarmed can dp no more barm to the dying believer than if it had been com pletely annulled It can indeed separate his soul from his body but it cannot separate either the one or the other irom Him who is the living Redeemer the resurrection and the life The dying of saint is but sleeping it is sleeping in Jesus Death to him is but the shadow of deaths it is not the substance It is not the Omega but the Alpha of his consummate felicity he then begins to live when he begins to die It is not the end either of his soul or of his body but only separation between them for an ap pointed time 4th LiCt him also study by an int creasing diligence in the exercise of every grace and in the practice of every duty to be always actually as well as habitually prepared for death and judgment for when he in this manner gives all diligence to make his calling and election sure he will through grace overcome gradually the disquieting fear of death and judgment and will rejoice in hope of eternal life Thus have endeavoured to point out to the exercised Christian those principal means of retaining and increasing spiritual consolation which he ought diligently to enploy The illustration of Tf Thess IV 14 Write don the reasons vhicb at any time make you afraid t6 die atid then endeavou by faith prayer and conversation with experienced Christiaos to remove the causes HRV ys Kules S60 THE MEANS OF INCREASIKG such of diem as the disquieted believer was iected to use for the recovery of his forfeited coii fort have studied as far as could to divernfy have only to add that if the ancere believer me them dHigently and if instead of resting in themi or depending on his use of them he rely only upon his great Redeemer for s3l grace and consolatioD he will increase in the principle and habit of spiritual joy and will in every time of need be favoured with sensible comfort From what has now been discoursed the pious reader may easily see that no other pleasures under the sun are to be compared to those of faith and holiness The pleasure erf true religion or of communion with God far surpass ail the other dehgbts of the sons of men In comparison of other plcasincs it is pleasantness itself pleasantness in die abstract The pains of sense have frequently conquered and destroyed the delights of sense hot those pains instead of having been able to conquer the delights of faith and holiness have in ten thousand instances been counterbalanced and conquered by them And while the pleasures of sense diminish the delights of religion increase with the using The longer holy man continues and tlie higher he advances in the exercise of faith and practice of holiness the greater and the sweeter is his delight Besides in order to enjofy and advance in the pleasures of religion he is npt called to relinquish any of the pleasures of sense but such as are sinful despicable and productive of misery Believer as none faatli so much reason to rejoice as thou see that thou exercise and in crease tby joy in the Lord Study to attain an increasing cheerfulness of disposition and pleasantness of manner These so far as they are spiritual will greatly promote holiness in thyself and will so adorn it as to recommend it much to ethers Are spiritual knowledge and faith principal means of advancing in holy consolation we may henoe infer that those are usually the sweetest Jicurs in the life of believer in which he has the deepest sense of his need of Christ the clearest discoveries of the fulness and suitableness of the willingness and glory of Christ and the firmest confidence in Christ for the supply of all his wants He commonly experiences the most solid comfort when he is most enabled and excited to intrust all his spiritual and temporal concerns to his Divine Redeemer whose power and grace whose thoughts and ways infinitely surpass the highest conceptions of men and angels ITiosc of the saints who have attained much sensible joy may from the foregoing particulars see how necessary it is for them to take heed that the height of their joy do not elate fkem xii7i pride or sclfsiifficiency The sensible joy of Gods salvation should never lift tlicm up with selfconceit and the want of such joy should never cast ihem down under disquieting and discouraging fear The want of sensible jpj should not for moment derive believers of their peacefiil ttan quillity of mind Their serenity of miod should be as great when they are with Jesus on mount Calvary sorrowing as when they are with him on the mount of transfiguration rejoicing The proper tendency of sensible joy is to humble lnrt through the depravity remaining in the heaiti it hath not always that effect Let such believers therefore as are favotired with sensible and five emotions of joy take heed that they never delight in them so much as in Jesus the Consolation of Israel that they never yield to any temptatioo to rest in them or trust on them and that tbcy never think themselves the more holy or the more acceptable to God because of them The more sensible joy they experience the more humble as well as selfdiffldeht tliey should be and the more fervent in spirit serving the Lord Lef such believers jis by grace have attained increasing consolation learn from What has beea said always to take heed that they do not suffer their fear of sinning and of losing their comfort to degenerate into perplexing scrtipulousjiess of conscience The npostle Peter exhorts believers to pass the time of their sojourning here in fear that is in filial fear which is fear of sinning against God their heavenly Father The Christian indeed ought daily to attain more and more of this filial fear but be ought also for hb comfort to keep it within its due bounds and not to siifler it to run out into vain and endless rupulosity of conscience He should by studying the law of God concerning sin and duty in every particular case have his conscience well informed If his persuasion that this or that which presents itself to be done is lawful and right be jgrounded upon his knowledge of the spirituality Pet 11 and great extent of diat holy law his persuasion in that case may be ful and firm and being firmly persuaded that it is according to the law and to the testimony he should without scruple resolve to do it But if his persuasion of the lawftdHess of that which he is requested or disposed to do be grounded on opinion only if he be of opinion miefdy that it is agreeable tO the law and SO not fiilly persuaded the will always remain secret doubt in his mind that the contrary is his duty and not this In such case if the arguments for the lawfulness of it appear to his Judgment more probable than those against the lawfulness of it he should resolve to do it without suffering his resolution to be sliaken by the latter But if the arguments against the lawfulness of it appear to his mind more probable than tho6e for it or even equally probable in that case doubting the lawfuliiess of it he ought 9wt to do it for the apostle Paul says He that loubteth is damned Condemned in his own tiiscience and by the word of God if he eat because he eatcth not of fakh for whatsoever is not of faith is sin Hie who does what he himself docs riot determine to be lawful and right but still doubts whether it be so or not sinneth for though he does that which may in itself and in the sight 6f God be materially rgi yet he does it not rightly because Iiq at the time doubteth wliefher it be lawful or not In order to prevent jiis ftiiiiiitig in such cases he should be fully per rsufided in his own mihd of the kiwfulncss of an Rom xiv 23 action before he resolves to perform it and then he will not condemn himself in that which he allows himself to do And when he is fiilly persuaded that he may do this or that lawfully and yet some objections to the contrary occur to his mind he ought not to delay doing it till these xlifficulties be solved for if he do others may arise Scruples will multiply the more tliey are attended to and will damp the resolution aixl so mar the comfort of the exercised Christian Has any believer after having been in the depths of spiritual trouble not only recovered spiritual consolation but attained an increase of it His duty is constantly to admire and praise those wonders of the wisdom power faithfulness and grace of Christ which he hath seen in those dcpths The floods of trouble and the waves of terror did beat vehemently upon his soulj but the Lord Jesus who sitteth upon the flood hath mercifully upheld him and hath drawn him oatof many waters He hath seen the wonders of the Redeemers wisdom in dispensing to Jhiim trouble and comfort terror and hope sorrow and joy and in teaching him by these means the malignity and bitterness of sin and the preciousness and freeness of grace the wonders of His power and love in sustaining his fainting soul under the pressure of his overwhelming distress and the wonders of His mercy and faithfulness in delivering him from the darkness of desertion and in bringing him forth to the light of communion with Him self Let him then with adoring gratitude ad Ps cvi 21 liiir6 and praise these wonders arid say with the holy Psalmist Thou art the God that doeth wonders He ought likewise with holy reverence and ardent love to say to his redeeming God Lord will praise thee though thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away and thou comfortest me Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent Lord my God will give thanks unto thee for ever Be assured Christian that it is good to sing praises unto our God for it is pleasant as well as comely it will infiise double sweetness into all thy enjoyments Though the Lord doth not need thy praises yet be is glorified by them and growing disposition to praise Him is necessary to thy own adTancement in holy consolation To conclude The Christian who is favoured with the cheering light of Gods gracious countenance may from what has been discoursed see that he is under tlie highest obligations to be more and more assiduous in using ail the means of obtaining daily increase of spiritual consola tion The sweetness and especially the usefulness of Iioly comfort for the purposes of his Redeemers glory should excite him to unwearied diligence in employing every appointed mean of attaining daily increase of it Let him

not only in assurance but Mnyiassurance of faith Now the way to attain establishment in solid consolation is through grace to become established in this assurance of faith The Christian must for that

DIUKC riOVS FOR ATTAWING God in him Supreme love to God is tlie principd grace the spring of all the cHher graces in holy souL It is in particular the principle of spiritual joy In proportion as holy man loves the Lord and enjoys communion with Him he delights and rgoices in him He delights and rejoices ill all his perfections and in all the manifested glory of them He rejoices in the works and in the word of the JLord delights in his preceptive and providential will and in his holy image whether he discerns it in himsetf or in others The infinite loveliness and love of God in Christ are objects of his supreme delight If therefore he is always loving and enjoying God he is always in the same proportion delighted and in proportion as he is delighted he of course must be comfortable he is established in the faith of Gods love to him and in the exercise as well as in the habit of his love to God he shall in the same degree be established in ENvine consolation It will be an inexpressible comfort to him to reflect that Heupou whom he hath set the supreme love of his heart is infinitely worthy of it Besides when he is established in his unfeigned love of God he is proportionably confirmed in his hatredof all sin and in proportion as he is firm in his holy abhorrence of all iniquity he is established in holy comfoit To be established therefore in supreme love to God and Christ is the way to become established in the comfort of the Holy Spirit Hence are these words of the apostle Paul to the believers at Colosse would that ye knew what greatooBflict have for you and for them at Laodieea and for as many as fative not seea my face in the flesh tiiat their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love as if he had said wrestle with God in prayer for all the saints that as tliey already are firmly cemented together in cordial affection to Christ and to one another so their hearts may be filled abundaBtly with holy consola tion He prayed for the latter as consecjnencc of the former Love is the most delightful affection of the soul When therefore it is set upon the Lord Jesus who is altogether lovely and who is for that reason the most deserving of it the more fixed and strengthened it is in the heart the greater must the delight and the stronger the consolation be which it will produce Accordingly when our Apostle said Who shall separate us from the love of Christ it was with holy Joy and even with triumph tliat he expressed those words how inexpressibly delightful and cheeiing is it constantly to love and always to be loved by Him who is the chiefest among ten thousand and altogether lovely yea love itself It will be necessary for the same purpose that the exercised Christian be establislicd in mUiiy and meekness He must be established in true AtMfy or evangelical humiliation of mind True humility is the eep and abasing sense which good man has of his odiousness as sinner the sight of God of his vileness as sinful

to abound more and more in the exercise of every grace implanted by the Holy Spirit in his soul By so doling spiritual declension and the loss of comfort will under sanctifying and consoling influences be happily prevented The apostle Peter in order to prevent the believers to whom he wrote fiom being so led away with the error of the wicked as te fall from their own stedfastness directed them to grow in grace Believers holding the head and having nourishment ministered ought in point of duty as well as of privilege to increase with the increase of God It their duty to grow up into Christ who is the head not only in all tilings but at all times Their path should always be as the morning light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day They ought at all times to grow inwardly by faith and love cleaving more firmly to Christ the head of gracious influences to grow outwardly by being more and more fruitful in good works to groW upward in heavenly mindedness and joy

of ain ydbidi remain in the heart of ithe believer are such that they will continually expose him to the daier of sinning in ae or other of ose ways in his purip suit or iuse of lawful things If then he would advance to establishment in spiritual comforthemust continually take heed that heo not in sinfiiji manner pursue and enoy lawful comforts It wiH be necessary that be be at ail times sober and Tigiiant lest he at any time so love the world Jer ii 13 Matth vi 3Xc as to use lawful things in sinful manner And it must be his constant endeavour through grace sd to use his outward comforts as to enjoy the inward comfort of communion with Christ in his use of them He must always live above them and never place his happiness in them He ought to keep them constantly in their own place and to value them not so much for themselves as for the opportunities and facilities which th afford himj of orifying his God and Saviour In order to be established in pure consolationi it will be no less necessary that the Christian be firmly fixed in his resolution and endeavour to avoid those places and that company which appear to have even remote tendency to draw him into sm He must for that purpose be always finn in his resolution never without evident necessity or clear providential caH to be present in the com pany of worldly land wicked men and when at any time he hath such call never to stay longer in their conipany than till his business with then be transacted He ought on all occasions to shew them that he loves their persons but not thciv company and that he is ready to do them all the good that he can but not to countenance them in any evil It must also he his firm resolution never to venture into their company how clear soever his call be till after he have intrusted his temper his manner and his object to that Saviour who preserveth the souls of his saints and who hath said to each of them wiJI teach theo on the way which thou shalt go will guide thee Psxcvii 10 with mine eye It is his duty to maintain constantly holy jealousy over himself and having tasted the sweetness of heavenly consolation to live as distant as possible from the ensnaring society of worldly men As he cannot approach too near to God so he cannot stand at too great distance rom sin It will not therefore be enough for him to keep himself merely from acts of sin he must endeavour constantly to abstain even from all appearances of evil and from that company and those amusements which have even remote tendency to lead him into sin Such conduct will indeed expose him to the contempt and ridicule oi ungodly men Some will account him designing hypocrite others precise formalist and othens weak and gloomy enthusiast Be it so his witness is in heaven and his record is on high He can say that never till he believed in Jesus Christ did he know what it was to enjoy real pleasure or true satisfaction He can from experience attest that communion with Christ in his redeeming love and grace is so delightful so cheering that one who has tasted the sweetness of it cannot but desire more and more of it in preference to all the mean gratifications the poUuted delights of carnal men The men of the world therefore should cease to wonder if the experienced Christian so conduct himself as to evince on fill occasions his firm resolution to prefer the marrow and fatness of pure consolation before the busks of vanity and sin Indeed such resolution manifested by suitable conduct is indispensably necessary to jestablisbcd comfort for though Fa xxxii Job xvi 19 the former doth not merit the

tree planted by the riven of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his sea son his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doth shall prosper The ungodly are not so If the advanced Christian would arrive at establishment in spiritual comfort he must attain ome degreeof eslabliskment in fie assurance of sense The assurance of sense is an assurance of vital union with Clurist or of personal interest in him founded on scriptural evidences thereof It is the believers certain knowledge of his being united to Christ and is built on the sense or experience which lie has of his possessing those evidences of union and communion with ChHst which are stated in the Scriptures In this place shall take notice only cAthree of those evidences 1st Saving ycM is sure evidericd of union with

and shall be saved but believe on him thereSoTC am united to him and shall be saved jnd in order to be satisfied tiiat his actings of fiiitli are unfeigned or not hpocritical let him in ilependance on the wilightening influences of the Spirit of truth attend carefully to the distinctions marked in the sacred Volume between true and counterfeit faith There he shall find that if man convinced of his

Jesus Christy that if he trust itt Jesus for salvation not upon the ground of previous qualitications in bimselfi but solely upon the warrant afforded by the gospeloffer call and comroandment to believe on the name of Jesus Christ that if he rely not like the hypocrite partly on his own performances and partly on the righteousness of Christ but on the righteousncss of Christ onfy for all his title to eternal life that if he trust in the Saviour not for salyation in sin or to sin as the hypocrite does but for yationrom all iniquity and especially from the sin that easily besets him or in other words for the xAole of salvation that if he trust for tliat salvation onltj which is wholly of sovereign giace and in which the glory of redeeming grace is most illustriously displayed and that if his faith work by loe and purify the heartthere he shall find say that if man exercise iiis iaitli and be conscious that he exercises it he may consider it as good evidence that he is united to Christ and interested in his righteousness and salvation That is the faith of Gods elect It is believing with the heart unto righteousness trusting in the Lord with all the heart and therefore when the Holy Comforter shineth upon it as his own work in the soul it cannot fail to be comfortable evidence to the Christian that he is in state of grace John ill 27 and iv 10 Rom Ix 31 32 Philip iii Sam

no hypocrfte or siiiner can love saint as saint how much soever he may regard him with affection on odier accounts 3d The practice of universal holiness or dbedi ence of heart and life to all the hommandments of the Moral law as ride of Itfb is likewise sure evidence of raaiis unioii aiid communion with Christ He that hath my commandments and keepeth fthem saith this Lord Jesus he it is that kweth tne Therefore whosoever hearetfa these sayings of mine and doth them wM liken him unto wise man who built his house upon rock Pa cxxxix 21 22 John xiv 21 MiUh ni 24 and the apostle John Hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments Whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby knam xoe that we are in him He that keepeth his commandliients dweUeth in him and he in him The behaviour or practice of every man who is vitally united to the holy Jesus is universally conformdl to the law as rule of doty Such holy practice is the grand business of his life the business in which he is chiefly engaged and which he pursues with more earnestness and diligence than he does any other His understanding is divinely enlightened to see the transcendent beauty of holiness his will is renewed to choose holiness and his afiections are sanctified to love desire and delight in it He is also constrained by the love commanded by the law and enablefl by the Spirit of Clirist to be holy in all manner of conversation He therefore makes the constant practice of universal holiness his choice his delight and in an eminent degree his employment Relying on the righteousness of Jesus Christ for all his title to eternal life trusting in Christ for continual supplies of grace and aiming in all his performances at the gkoy of God he perseveres through all changes and under all trials in the love iind piactice of universal holiness tt the end of life He may indeed be left to be guilty in ome degree of spiritual declension and may be suffered to yield so far to some temptations as John ii John lii 24 Pet 15 ESTABLISHED COMFORT SS9 even to fall occasionally into great sins but he shall never be permitted so to fall that it will cease to be his manner even in the most difficult situationsy to perform sincerelyy all duties required of him even the most hard Now when man is conscious that relying on the suretishiprighteousness of Jesus Christ for all his title to life eternal that trusting in Christ for all promised supplies of sanctifying grace and believing the love which God hath to him he is enabled cordially to perform obedience to all the commandments of Christ when he finds that he is enabled to yield universal obedience not that it may secure him from heJI or entitle him to heaven not merely because he is bound to perform it but Because he is constrained by the love of Christ and because he wishes and delights and resolves to da it when is conscious that he pursues and practises universal holiness according to the law as rule from principles of supreme love to God and of unfeigned gratitude to Jesus Christ who fulBUed all righteousness for him according to the same law as covenant and when he knows by experience that he has been enabled under manifold trials resolutely to cleave to Christ and his word and habitually to make tlie glory of Christ and of God in Hii the chief end of all his performances he ought to consider this holy obediencej as asure distinguishing evidence that he is united to the Lord Jesus Indeed universal holiness of heart and of life is the most sure the most unexceptionablc evidence of personal interest in Christ It is the sign of signa the chief of all the signs of grace No faith is an evidence of union Wli Christ but that which is mode perfect by vorks No love is sign of it but that which is perfect cd in keeping his word Holy practice is the highest evidence of connection with the holy Je gus the great mark of distinction betwe the children of God and the children of the de vii It is very remarkable that this evidieAce is much more insisted on in the Scriptures than any other Blessed are the uudcfikj the way who walk in the law of the Lord Then shall not be ashamed whtn have respect unto all thy commandments If ye love me saith our Lord keep my commandments If man love me he will keep my words He that loveth not ke cth not my sayings Herein is my Father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye Be ny disciples Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever command you Little cliildrtn says the npostle John let no man deceive you he that doth righteousness is righteous even ash is righteous Whosoever doth not righteousness is not of God This is the love of God that we keep his commandments The man therefore who is truly conscious that from principles of faith and love and for the glory of God he forsakes with abhorrence every known siq and stu dies to know and to perform cordially every commanded duty may warrantably assure himself that he is united to Christ and is in state of grace Let the believer then endeavour dilient James ii 22 Joh ii John iii 10 Ps cxix Vetfte John xv 15 23 24 John XV 814 JoW uv VVi Jha to attain more and more of this high evidence of grace so shall he arrive not only at sensible assurance of his union with Christ but at establishment in that assurance Indeed when man trusts with cordial and strong confidence in Christ Jesus for salvation he trusts that Christ will qffbrd him evidences of salvation and the consequence will be that his mind will never be entirely at ease till he see that he has at ileast the evidences above mentioned Whatever degree of the assurance of Jaithy he attains he will in the same degree be diligent to attain as soon as possible the assurance of sensey and establishment in this assurance And here must remind the exercised Chris tian that how diligent soever he may be in the practice of holiness he cannot attain this holy as surance much less establishment in it but by the testimony of the blessed Spirit the Comforter It is the same Holy Spirit who bath implanted in hi Iiieartj all savinggraces that can by shining upon them make him kmm the things which are freely given to him of God As the sua cannot be en but by itswn light so the graces and fruits jM the Spirit cannot be certainly known but by the light ofthe Spirit The believer cannot be 4Bsured that the Spirit dwelleth in him as sanctifier otherwise than by the same blessed Spiiit as ComRirter The Spirit itself or the same Spirit says the apostle Paul beareth witness with our spirits that we are tlie children of God The same Spirit that worketb habits of grace or holy dispositions in the hearts of believers doth Cor ii 12 Romiii 16 J2 DIRECTIONS FOR ATTAmiKG by shining upon these by exciting their attention to them anti by enabling them to compare them ith the signs of adoption mentioned in Scriptare concur with their consciences in witnessing that ifliey are the children of God In order then to attain such establishment in sensible assurance as will introduce establishment in spiritual comfort the Christian must irequentl3r tpust as well as pray for the witnessing of the Holy Spirit and he should continually take heed that he do not grieve the Spirit Moreover In order to his being established in pure consolation the believer must endeavour with all diligence to make rigJU tuid profitable ttse of the holy Saeraments These are the aeals of the covenant ef graoe for they were instituted in order to cojifiim that holy covenant with true believers They accordingly in the hand of the Holy Comforter are special means of nfirminj that everlasting covenant with them and they confirm it with them not by making it firmer in Itself than it is already but by confirming their Jaith of it and by clearing up or confirming to them their personal interest it and in all the blessings promised in it The believer then in order to be established in spiritual comfort roust improve Ats baptiim both for confirming his assurance of faith andibr confirmuig his assurance of personal interest iii the everlasting covenant He ought for these purposes to improve it at all times but especially when he is called either to present child for baptism or to witness ESTABLISHED COMFORT 393 Ute dispensation of baptism to the child of another Seeing baptism in the room of circumcision is seal especially of the righteousness of faith he should in witnessing the dispensation of it renew his cordial application of the spotless righteousness of Jesus Christ which in the gospel is revealed from faith to faith Since the water in baptism represents the cleansing virtue of the blood and the Spirit of Christ he ought when he sees the baptismal water applied to the body to seize tlie precious opportunity afforded him of applying the justifying blood of Christ to his con science for cleansing it from the guilt and pollution andthe sanctifying Spirit of Christ to his heart for cleansing it from the power of sin And Inlying on the righteousness and blood of Jesus for complete title to deliverance from the gnilt the power and the XlIution of sin and trusting in the Lord Jesus himself for all hi salvation he siiould then within himself say certainly as have now seen the baptismal watery sprinkled upon the body of that infant the blood and the Spirit of Christ arc miW not only in ofiev but in possession and while they are mine to justiiy sanctify and comfort me Christ himself is mine as ny Cove nanthead and Gkxl is mine as my CovenantGod Jrom henceioFth and for ever And seeing that tlie child is in its baptism solemnly dedicated to the luord he ought further to say Lord devote myself and all that am to thee to be thine wholly only and for ever to be saved by thy grace dnd to be employed for thy glory That the exercised Christian may attain esta blmhment in true consolation he must likewise improve the holy Sacrament of the Suppers he must ivith increasing diligence improve it for the Gonfirmation both of his assurance of faith and of his assurance of union and communion with his great Redeemer When afler due preparation he hath sat down at the Gommnnioiitable he ought with suitable affections not only to remember and meditate on the amazing love of Cbristj in serving and suffering iophim but upon seeing the sacramental bread given him to say As certainly as the sacred bread is now given me with oommand to take and to eat of it Jesus my gracious my crucified Redeemer is now given me in offeri and the offer together with the commandment to believe on his name affords me warrant to accept and to trust in Him And when he is taking and eating of the bread heshould from his heart say Lord Jtens upon the warrant of thy offer and command now accept thee as my only Saviour and trust with firm confidence in thee for ali my aalvadon Upon seeing the onp of blessing piesoited tohim he riioukl not forget to say As certainly as this cup is

commandment to believe on bis name affirds me full right to receive and sely am them And when he is taking apdldrinkiag of the cop he ought to say my adorable Redeemer now upon arraxMi of thy free offer and mitkorita tive command accept thy consummate righteousness and rely upon it only for all my title to the inestimable blessings promised and bequeathed in the new testament ratified by thy death and bo licviug that thy righteousness and all thebenefit merited by it are given me in offer upon the warrant of thy authentic offer and command it cordially that thou givest them to me also in pos session Appropriating and feeding thus upon the body and blood of the incarnate Redeemer the believers faith is confirmotl and all hi ether graces arc proportioiiably strengthened for it is unto hi2 according to his faith Moreover conscious that his heart is accepting and trusting ill the JLord Jesus for all the bless ings bequeathed in his testament the belier ought upon hearing these cheering words Thia ismy body brokenyr yow and This cup is the new testament in my blood which is siied fifi you to assure himself that Cliriit with his rteousness and salvation is kisy not only in ofifer bat in possession And he should regard the brad and the cup now gijren him as visible tokens and pledgesf of hid union and communion with his dear Redeemer and his personal interest in all the promises and blessings of the new covenant or in othev xyords having in the exercise of trusting in Jesus Christ for alvatioa to himself in parti eular received the bread and the cup he Ought to

witli him of that ineffable joy wherewith he always rejoiceth over his church If Christian instead of being of liberal and public spirit is contracted in hi views and concerned mainly for his own welfare and that of particular party he is not qualified for strong and durable consolation Established comfort like fame will elude the grasp of him who pursues it merely or chiefly for himself and or its own sake One reason perhaps why some believers at this day have Jittle spiritual and lasting eomfort is that in comparison ef it they care little for any thing else If they were more empkyed in seeking the glory of Christ the success of his blessedgospel and the extension of his spi ritual kingdom both at home and abroad than in seeking ease and comfort for themselvesj they llsa IxvL 10 11

that holy consDation which every true believer wil eternally enjoy Ought sincere believers to endeavour with all diligence to attain establishment in the assurance 9f faith as primary mean of attaining established comfort It ipUgws tht evry believer should Constantly strive to attain stro7ig faith Without strong ind lively faitb the Christian may haire comtort but he cannot have settled comfort he cannot be habitually cheerful he cannot tiss joice evermore he cannot cleave resolutely to the promise when providence without or sense within aeems to contradict the promise It is on ly by strong feith that the believer can live as child in the iamily liveswithout anxious care or fear As often as Christ removes the burthen of contracted guilt from the conscience the weak believer lays on again and then sinks under it but the strong believer takes the Saviour at his word and reU with firm confidence on Him for pardon and eternal life Thus being strong iji fiiith hfe glorifies God and God according to his faith comfortettx him If his heavenly Father do at any me frown upon him and smite him he believes His love rather tlian his own feeling Weak faith says The Lord Jesus can save me if be will but strong iaith says He both can and will save me The strong believer lives not so much upon the comlbrts of God as upon the God of all comfort He draws his consolation from the higher springs even while the waters of the Ipwer springs are rillining And were all his earthly comforts to fail him he knows that he hath still one comfort which is of infinitely more value than them all Jliis God is my Ged for ever Bfid ever He trusts finply all necessary consolation in his God and Saviour who change not and therefore no outward changes which DftD iii 16 11 Ps xxjii xiviiL 14 befal can effect any considerable change in bur spirit He knows that he cannot be poor so lonj as his CovenantGod is rich for all the riches of God are his believer strive diKgently to at tain strong vigorous and an operative faitL Watch and resist the veiy first appearances of declension in the life of faith Hold fast the truth in opposition to errors of every kiiid Hold it fast in thy understanding and judgment in thy will and affections and in thy confession and whole conversation Hold fast the faithful word as thou hast been taught Keep the truth and the truth wiU keep thee comfortable and happy Seek for an established judgment and firm faith in all the truths of the glorious gospel Should the Christian in order to arrive at stable comfort endeavour to be rooted and grounded in love Then he must study in the faithof Gods redeeming love to him so to love God in Christ as to be at all times pleased with Him In proportion as he loves his God and Father he will be pleased with him with all his perfections and with all his will and if he be always pleased or delighted with God he will In the same proportion be always comfortable always delighted in his own soul To be constantly pleased with God iii Christ and with all the will of God is indeed difficult and high attaiimient but the believer cannot otherwise become so rooted and grounded in love to him as to attain settled consolation To love Grod supremely and to be so pleased with him as to be constantly disposed in all things to ilease him are in efTcct the same If then ood man would attain established consolation he must by grace become firmly fixed in holy and habitual endeavour always to be pleased with God and always to please him One happy consequence would be that trusting and praying only for such things as are agreeable to the holy will of God he loidd not be disappointed and another would be that loving the providential will of the Lord he would frequently observe providence and would perceive such traces of love to him in providential dispensations as would greatly establish him in spiritual consolation Whilst unfeigned love to the brethren is as has been remarked above an evidence of union and communion with Christ it appears at the same iime to be an instituted mean of establishment in spiritual comfort By the exercise of sincere love to the brethren holy man enjoys communion with them which heightens his enjoyment of communion with Christ The more he loves them the more is he disposed to cover multitude of sins in them and to think no evil of them It is want of love to the saints that usually dis poses man so to quarrel and contend with them as to mar his own comfort in fellowship with them Hence the apostle Paul exhorted the believers at Corinth to be of one mind and to live in peace in prder that they might be of good comfort He urged brotherly love and unanimity upon those at Philippi by an argument drawn from lPet iv8 CorIli Cor xiii 11 the comfort of love The mwre believer loves the brethren the more pleasure does he take in them and the more pleasure he takes in diem and in their company the more pleasant will he be to them and the more disposed will he be to be of one accord of one mind with them and in lowKness of mind to esteem them better than himself His love of diem and his delht in their company will render him very unwillfng to deprive himself of the comfort of their society by difiering without necessity in opinion from them The diversity of opinions in religion among Christians at this day and the divisions which ensue are believe as much owing to the want of perfect love to the brethren as of perfect knowledge Ought the believer to be always firm in his resolution to avoid such company as appears to have tendency to draw him into sin then he must learn never to feel uncomfortable far less to murnmr when men of the world appear not to esteem him The exercised Christian is always fool in the account of worldly men and he will not little mar bis own comfort if he look for respect from them He ought never to expect that they will esteem him as holy man so long as they do not regard holiness itself Indeed it would discover both ignorance and pHde in him to murmur when they slight him He is unknown to worldly and wicked men and therefore be should not for moment be unea if he find himself disregarded by them Najr if he wooM attain establishment in heavenly XnsoIation he Philip ii 13 must not sttfibr himself to be in the least disquietei though heshould find that even some of the saints themselves appear to disregard him He should remember that even the holiest of men can in no higher degree be attentive to him than the Loid is pleased at the time to make them Is establishment in humility of mind requisite to sainfs establishment in pure and holy comfort the believer may hence learn that the more de and abiding his sense of weakness is the stranger he is The strongest believer has in one sense no more strength inherent in himself than the tweakest He is as incapable of resisting motions of sin and of performing spiritual obedience by his own strength as he was when he first began to know the Lord In another sense however he is more strong and more firmly settled in holy tranquillity of soul because he has more deep and feeling sense of his own weakness and un worthiness and more constant dependance ort Christ for continued supplies tf grace Thus he is strong not iii himself but in the Lord and in the power of His might and the stionger he is in theigrace that is in Christ Jesus the stronger will his consolation be It is also evident from what has been said that as the peace which believers have in Christ doth not exempt them ixm outward afiiiction in the world so they ought to take heed that outward affliction do at no time deprive them of or even lessen their inward peace and consolation in Him Outward and even inward trouble are dispensed to saints in order not to destroy but to increase and establish their holy tranquillity and joy in the Lord Jesus AOiictions are sent diat tliejr may be means of prqaring them for deriving in creasing degrees of spiritual and strong consolation from his fuhiess When the sufferings of Christ or any calamities whatever abound in them it is not in order that their consolation may diminish but that it may abound hy Christ If afl9ictions are dispensed it is to take smaller comforts out of the way or to make them cease to be any longer comforts in order to make room for greater BeUevers therefore when they are under affliction of any kind should never suffer their grief or their fear to hinder them for moment from trusting and rcgoicing in Christ Jesus who is brother born for adversity On the contrary while they are under trouble as well as after they are delivered from it they ought to fall in so enUrdy with the gracious design of God in dispensing it as resolutely to endeavour to confide and to rgoice in the great Redeemer Thus their hearts will be fixed trusting in jjbe Lord and they will enJoy peaceful and stable tranquillity in the midst of changing and troublesome world Thus desiring above all things and trusting that the infinitely sovereign wise and holy will ofGodf may be accomplished in them tliey will rejoice in the cheering thought thai in subservience to the glory of Christ in their salvation all things work together for good to them AfiSicted be liever thy grief arising from what thou feelest either of the plague of thy heart or of the pressuve of thy calamity should never be

themselves with that when they are called to faith and love to patience and holy activity for God Were those of the saints who are favoured widi comfortable discoveries of their evidences of inherent holiness to take frequent occasion from those evidences to think of Christ and to set their hearts the more on his consummate righteousness as the only ground of their title to holiness and comfort they would thereby attain more assurance of their personal interest in him and more estaUishment in pure consolation When the apostle Paul was assured that Christ already lived in him be took occasion from that to live the more by faith on the righteousness and fulness of Christ live says he yet not but Christ liveih in me and the life which now live in the flesh live by the faith of the Son God who loved me and gave himself for me At the very time in which the same Apostle had his eye fixed upon his having the excellent knowledge of Christ Jesus he had his heart taVen up with the righteusness of Christ If the believer then would maintain solid and stable comfort let him think more of the Lord Jesus and delight more in Him and in his righteousness and fulness than in his own
