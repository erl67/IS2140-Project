13. In every artificer, or one that workes by counfell ^^ txtra^ outwardly,there is a platfornae afore baad in the mind which when he i« about to worke hee lookes into, that lie may fit his worke to it; fb alfo in God,leeing he wort) cth not naturally nor raftily, nor byconftraint,but with^ greateft perfeftion of reafon,//)^<rA a flatforme is to be conceived^ to fr^xift bcfere in his mind^ as the exemplary canfcofall thing8tobedone.H^.ii.3. Thofe things we fee were made of things that doe not appeare.

15. A platforme in the mind of man,who attaines to knowledge by Analyfis or refolution is coilefted of things them-fclvcs: and fo things are firft in themfelves^thcn they come untothefcnftsofmcn, and then to the underftandingWjhere they can make fome Idea to direft the foliowing^operatlon.

17. An^^^f^inmanis firft imprinted and afterwards cx-prefled in the things : but in God it is only exprdfing properly 5 not imprefled, became it doth not come from any o-therthinc^.

- H.From this one foundation may all errors of merits and forefecnc faith be fufficiently »refced.For li^iny Decree of God (hould depend properly upon (uch fore^ghc, then the Ij^^ of God ihould come to him from fomething elfe^ which doth in no wife agree with his nature.

ip. The/^^<!rorplatforme, asitisabfoludyconfidered in God,is only one, but as it includes divers refpefts to the Creatures, it becomes manifoldjfo that it is true, that the ^Idca of one Creature is not the Idea of another.

20. There are in God platformes of all perfeftions which \ are in the Creatures, becaufe they proceed from the adive

powerofGod :but not of iraperfe(flionS3if they be formally confidered as imperfcftion?.

21. Therefore the knowledge of evill depends upon the denying of good , as the being of cvlU confifts in privation of good 3 for every thing as ic hath its being, fo It is knowne.

39. Therefore there is no caufe properly focalled^tobe given of Gods Will.

40. H nceitisrighily faidjthat'Goji doth will one thing to exift for another; but not that tbit one thing is a proper caufe whereby the Will of God is iiiwardly moved to appoint that other thing. So God we)iild that the Sunna andftars ftiould exlft, for the generation, confcrvationjandi corruptJonof things below ; yet theSunneand Stars 5 aro not a caufe why God would that thofe things fiiould be gci^ ncrated, conferved , and corrupted. And fo it is in all things cut of God, which indeed among themfelves are rao(ea and cffefts,even as they depend upon the Divine will^but therj is no caufe of Gods Will out of it fel fe, \

: 41. Alfo the willing of ©nc thin^g luGod, is not properly a caivfecflFefi:ingihat he wil another thing in bimfelfe, becaafe the Efficiency of a canfe upon an cffcftj.and d-epen-dance of the tfFeft upon a caufe^.cannot be in the Will of God 5 which is God himfelfe, truly and (imply willing all things togcjhierandr>iiC^aii?ce; i ivith one oncjly jaft i^ycat it Is true that the Sch&oM^friiky^i\i^t^)ipA^i attiugency ofthe Divine will in rcfpcft of oneHhitjg ,: is- a caiifc of a paflive at-tingcncy in refpeft of another: and fo m this fence it is truly' andpita>(lyfaid^thatOod willethfomeonethings becaufehci willeth anothec^ i ^ \ r W; . : 7

4 }. Wherefore that oprnion which determines that God doth will fometbing antecedently to the aft of the Grca-tmty which fame thing afterwards he wiHcth not towards them,but wills another thing ^ is not to be admitted: bc-cauft it makes the Will of God mutable and depending upon the aft of the Creature,{b that as oftca as the aft of the Creature is ch2nged 3 (b often alfo it is changed.

things that may be known, and power can docallpcffiblc things, and they are ftrctched forth together beyond thofc things which a^ually have been, are^and (hall be ; but by his prill he willeth not all things he can will, but all things which hejudgeth to be willed, and therefore aSually to be hereafter ; whence it is that although God tnay be called^ Oainifcicntj and Omnipotent, yet he cannot be called Onar nivolcnr.

48. Whatfoever God wilicth in all thefe things^he is uni-verfally efFeftaall : io as he can in no wife be hindred, or friiftrated, whereby he cannot obtaine what he wiUs.Vox if he ftiould properly will any tbiug^^and could not obtaine it , he ftiould not be moft perfeft and blefled,

49^ Yet the fVilt ot God doth not infer a ncceflity upon al future thingSjbut a certainty only as touching the event* » So it could not be as to the certainty of the event, that the

$0t Nay it is fo far off^ that the will of God, which doth moft certainly attaine to whatfoever it »///(?rA 5 doth urge all things with hard necefllty, that it is the prime reote, and efficient cau(c of all that contingency, and freedome,which is in things: becaufcit dotheflFedually foreordaine fuch efFefti to follow of filch caufef.

51.

of Creation.

!• f I • He Efficiency of God,is either Creation or Provi-I dence*

X. 2. Creation is the Efficiency of God whereby he made the World of nothing, in the beginning very Igood.

3. Aftive Creation is conceived ^ by the manner of a tranfi-cnt aflion 3 in which there is alwayes an Objcft prefuppofed about which the agent is exercifcd^ yet ic is not formally traniicnt,but only virtually j becaufe it doth not prcfiippoft, but make an Objeft.

4. Paffive Creation is conceived by the manner ofmutati* on^which is improperly called mutation*

• 5. Creation refpcfts the whole worldjthatisjwhatfocver doth cxift befides God,

6. Hence, both all things which exift befides God arc created, and they are altogether created ^ that is.as well ac* cording to matter, as according to formca Rev. 4. 11. Bc-cau(e thou haft made all thing?* j^ol.i.i6. For by him were niade all things which are in Heaven;^aDd which arc In Earth, vifibleandinvifible.

7 Creation doth produce Originally, becaufe itprodu-ccth abeingjootonly as it ft a being, but alfo abfolutly in every part*

8. There-



^.Therefore before the Creatien^ the Creatiires had no reall being either of exiftencCjOr Eflcnce, although they had a known being.from eternity in the knowledge of God*

9. Cri?^^^» then produceth out of nothing, that is, out of matter that doth not prascxift 5 that hath a being before^hwx co-€xift 5 that hath a being together with the th'iKg created : For there was nothing from eternity befides God, neither is God the matter or part of any Creature^ but only the efficient cau(e.

I o. Indeede fomethings are faid to be created, whofe matter did pre-exift : but then Creation refpcils not only that immediate aftion^ whereby it comes to paflc that (iieh things arc 5 but alfo aniediatc aftion,whereby it comes to pafleihat the matter ic felfe Qiould exift of which they are formed: fo it was in the Creation of plants and living Creatures, Genef%i.zo.

!!• Thatnothing, or not being of things, did goe before their being : not only in order of nature^^ for (b they might co-exift with God from externity : but alfo in order of duration 3 continuance, according to our manner oi cotkf ceiving* )

12. Hence that beginning in which God is faid to creates the Worldjwastheend of that duration which nothisg had, aad the beginning of that which a the world had.

ij.Thcrefore God would by the Creationy both Jhew forth hisperfeftion, that he did not neede a^iy Creature or outward thing; for then he had created the world as (bone as he could. And alfo his freedome whereby he brought forth all things 'without naturall neceffity, for if he had created neceflarily 5 he had done it from eternity. Rez. 4, n^ 7>/. 115. 3^

14, The world neither was made from eternity, neither could be created from eternity^inthat difpofition, and order of chingSjWhich now it hath.

i 5, That day had not been, if infinite dayes ought to have pone before/or thofe dayes going before had never been en-dcd,that that might lucceed themt

16.Hence alfo it followcth that no Creature was, or could be a caufe either inftrumental],or principall in the aft of Cr^. t*^». 17. Every

I yet they cannot be caufts really efficient, norindeed^ inftru-

^ 14. The Providence of God is either confervation or gu-

15. Conftrvation is that whereby God makcth all thingi, bothuniverfall, andfingularj both in their Eflcnce and exi-ftence, and in their ftrength, to perfift, and continue. P[kL io4.i9,20. AElsij.i^.Heb^i.^. Which is of Schoolemcn, not unfitly called tJM^nHtenentia, Dei ^ Gods holding in his ^^^ hand , becauie by it God doth (uftainc all things as with his Hand.

17. Gods conftrvation is neceflary for the Creature be-cauft the Creature doth every way depend upon the Qreator^ not only as touching its Pieri. i« being to be made, but al(b

PpUme 104429. If thou hideft thy Face^they are troubled, if thou takeft away their breath they die, and returne to their duft.

9. From this fpeciall and proper way of governing rea-fonable Creatures , there arifeth that covenant^ which is between God and them. For this covenant is as it were a cer-taine tranlaftion of God with the Qre^ture^ whereby God commandethjpromifeth^thrcatnethj fulfillcih^and the Crea^ ture doth tie ic fclfe in obedience to God thus covenanting.

10. Now becaufe this way of entring into covenant is not between tbofe that are equall, but between Lord and fcrvant.

\ Therefore it pertaincs to government, whence alfb it is moft J properly called not the covenant of manjbut of God.who is y the authorj and chiefe Executor of it.^Df/^r.S.ij. 18.That he may performe his covenant*

pre-



prefcription ^ or ordering the event that folloWcs upon it.

16. This Was the fame Law as touching the fubftance^with the morall Law which is contained in the Decalogue.

17. Yet thofe in the Decalogue are to be excepted which eitherpertaineto the nature of mans body 5 or the tondirjon ofthisjnortalllifc, which take no place rn them: a? many things of propagation pertaining to th^ leventh precept. Mat. 22. 30.

18. The ordering of the event, was in forae, a preftrvati-on to perfift in obedience. Hence it is that they were confirmed in good, and endowed with fiill hapj. inefle,(b t&atthey doe immutably clcavi to Cod, with pcrfeiS obedience, and fuUncflc ot gloi y.

Thu4 m^ch ef the government of Anaells* The government of Man foUovpes.

^5. In th€ fpeciall government of rnenj T^o things arc to be obi[crvcdj as in the government of Angclls , namely prescribing a Law, and ordering the eveirt that would thence follow. Yet there is not the fame reafon of all on either fide.

26. In prcfcribing a Law there is like reafon. i. In that the Law prcfcribed to Men and Angells,was chc fame as touching the EiTencc of it: namdy morally thefomme whereof is in the Decalogue. 2. In that that k was written in the heart by way of habit^wherein the firft reafon ofconfcience is placcd,which is called Sjynerefis.Rorf .2.15.

27. But the diflirailicudej and difference is diver?. For^ Firft, The principles indeed of this Law arc common to Angclls and Men , but many (ecundary conclulions arc only proper to men : asof Parents^ mariagc, meats , and the like.

j 28.Secondly, feeing m:^n is of a more imperfeft nature then -^Angells, and fo needs more inftruftfon and cxerci(c, therefore there was added cp the Law of nature a certaine poficive thing^othei wile ofckafame reafon with U: a$ the fanftifying of the feventh day.

2g. Thirdly, becaufe Man in this animaUIife doth undcr-ftancl by fences, and (b is as it vvere led by the hand from fenfible things cointelligible and fpiritual! , therefore unto xhat fpirituaJl Law there were added unto Man outward Symbolesi and Sacrament^^toilJuftrate,and confirm it. And in thefe Symbt>ks,there was contair^ed, both a certaine fpe-c\z^\ ind pofitive Law^and a profeffion of general! obedience to the Law of narure befoie put into him and al(b a confirraa • ^

tionofthatfolemnfanftionoftheLaWj which didconfiftof promifes^and threatnJngs.

30. Fourthly J becaufe /tJiam wa« the beginning of man-kindj outofwhom^'i Men were to be derived, therefore a Law is given to him not only as one private perfbn^ as was done in the Angeils > but alLb as a publique perfbn ^ or

the



[the head of mans nature, from whom all good and evHl was [to be derived to his pofterity. ^/f5ls 17. 26. Rom.^aS^ls^.

31 .Fifthly jin the (anfiion of this Law, there was contained a promile, of continuing animall life, and of exalting it afterward to fpirituaU, asalfo a threatning of bodily death which had no place in the Angells.

33, Unto this covenant there were two Symboles, or Sacraments adjoyned , In one of which the reward due to Obedience was fealed by aTiee^namely of life^and in the other the puniflimenc of difobedience was fealed by a Tiee, namely of knowledge of good and evi/l ; that was a Sacrament of life, this a Sacrament of death. j

Chapter XL

I to be conlidered ttVoT^o-ij • and dpclTaa-ig^ tMans Fall^

JLand his reftoring. Rom.^.ig. i Cor. 15. a i.

2. In the Angells there was prcfervation of (bme, and

and

V



and apoftafy, together : becaufc all men were created in one Adam,as in the beginning/octe^and head : but in one and the fame u4daf9f ^ fome men could not be prefcrved from the Fal/^ and others Fa//.

3. In the Angells there was no «V«V-(ir/j or Reftoring. Firft, Becauft they Fell from the higheft top of excellency : Secondly, becauie in the F^//of Angells, all the Angelical! nature did not perifli, but by the (in of the firft Man all mankind did perifti.

4. The Ap9flacj of Man is his Fall from obedience due to God , or a tranfgreffion of the Law prefcribed by God«

5^ In this Fall two things are to be confidercd. i. The committing of Uie tranfgreffion.2. The propagation of it.

6. The committing of the tranfgreffion was accomplifli-cd in the eating of the forbidden Fruit, which was called the Tree of the knowledge of Good and Evill: but the firft motion or degree of this difobediencc 5 did neceflarily goc

)before that outward ad of eating , fo that it may be truly faid that Man was a finner ^ before he had finifticd that outward aft of eating. Whence it is that the very dclire which Eve was caried with toward the forbidden Fruit, doth ftemc to be noted, as fome degree of her fin. Gen* 3* 6. When the Woman faw, that the Fruit of the Tree was good for Meate, and moft delightfull to the Eyes, and the Fruit of the Tree to be defired to get knowledge (he tookc and eat.

7. Therefore the firft degree and motion of this di(bbe-dienccj wsiS an inordinate defire of fome excellency, by the lifting up of the mind: which that fhe might attainc, the forbidding of God being laid afidc, through unbelief e,flie would make triall 5 whether the forbidden Fruit had fome »>ower to confer (uch an excellency.

8. Hence was the grievoufiieffc of this fin 5 which did not only containe pride, ingratitude , and unbeliefe ) but alfoby violating of that moft folemne Sacrament, did make (hew of, as it were a generall profeffion of dilobedience, and contempt , of the whole covenant, AH which alfo were fo much the more foule by how much the condition of the hnner was more perfeft.

H ?.In



so Mans Fall^

$• In the committing of this tranfgrcflion two things arc to be confidcredjthc caufeSj and confcqucnts of it.

I o. Caufes were one principal!. And others adjuvant.

II. The principall caute was man himfelfe, bytheabufe of his free-will. Bccle(<j.i^. For he had received that righte-oufiieffe, and grace by which he might have perfifted in obedience if he would. That rightcoufnefle and grace was not taken fronrhim before he had finned, although that ftrength-ning and confirminggrace by which the aft of finning (hould have been aftually hindred, and the contrary aft of obedience brought forth was not granted unto him, and that by thecertaine^wiiej and juft counfellof God. God tberforc Was in no wife the caufe of his Tdl : neither did he lay npon man a neceflicy of falling,but man ot his own accord, did freely-FW/from Gocf^.

i2.The adjuvant caules were the Dcvill, and the Woman.

13. ThefirftfinofthcDivellwas pride : From pride did prefently follow envy towards God , and Gods Image in Man 5 For bccaufe he had loft an orderly Excellency by af-r fcfting one out of order, therefore the JExcellency of othersl grieveS him, and he was malicioufly bent to oppoft ir# But(l theDevill was not the compelling caufe , neither the caufe "^ of fufficicnt dircft neceflary or certaine efficacy in procuring that fin : but only the ccunfcUing and perfwading caufe^ by icmptingjwhence alfo it is that hc.hath the name of the tempter-.^/^r. 4.3, ^ '

14. The tempting of the Divcll is a fallacy, or fophifticall argumentation : whereby under a fhew of that which is trucj and goodj he labours to fcducc to that which is falfc: and ih-^^ ducc to that which i&cvill.

15. lo this tentation, the good which he propoundcd,and aS'it were promifed^was fliewed to be as it were thcgrcatcft : the way to be ufed to attaine that good, was propounded to be as it were eafic,and light: that greateft cvill which did hang over his hcadjWas hidden from him.

id.Thc Dcvill is wont to goe tlK like way in all his tenta-tioDS ; which he doth infnare mankind with ; yet in this tentation a ccrtaine fpcciall cunning is to be obferved which ^^ containcs many craf(;s,and thofc very fubtilc.



Mam Pall.

17. The firft of them was lo that he cho(e z Serpent^ his inftrnment which had a certainc naturall aptnefle, which the Devill knew how to abufc.

i8 The fccond flight was in that he dcaic with the Woman iTim.ui^. Whether in the prefencc^erabfcnce of her husband the Scripture is filent.

19. The third flight was in that he determined nothing at the firft fpeech: but only propounded a certaine que&ion to the Woman,as if he were ignorant of tbofc niatters>Hath God indeed faid?

20. The fourth was that his queftion had much ambiguity in it, for fo might be underftood that heftiouldnotaskeaf Gods command, but of the fence or meaning of that command 3 peradventurc not fufficiently underftood by nianj If the queftion be underftood of the command it felfe, then he might (ccm to have asked whether God had forbidden them, that they (hould not at all cat of the fruit of any Tree, or as the Woman her felfc anfwcrcd whether he had forbid-

Jden them the ule of that one Tree^and fo had notiimply given them leave for all. 2r# The jfift was that having firft called the command of God into doubt by that queftion^he did fo artifically extcnuat the fanftion of it ^ or comasination adjoyned in the conceit of the Woman now wavering, that ftie ftiould deny either the truth, or atleaft the neceffity ofit.

22. The (ixtwas thatafterhehad weakned theComman-dement, andthe (anftion ofir, he^oth oppofe a prediction quite contrary. ^' ►

23. The fcventh was that to confirmethat prediftion , he doth both abule the Name of God, and the Name which GodhadimpofcdontheTrce. gen.:^.'^. God knoweththac what day ye (hall eat thereof your Eyes ftiall be opened, and you ftiall be as Gods, knowing G^d and Evill.

24. Hence it is that the Divell is called a Serpent , a Lyer^ ^ Sedncer^z Man^jlajer. Revelations li*^. John S,4^: Rev.20.io^

25. Withthis tempting of the Dcyill thfitt \it2i joyned the tempting of God ^ whereby he did (6 order that bu-liagflc, that it might thence be manifeft what was in Man.

? : •• Ha But

$1



e2 ConfequenU of the Fall.

But this tempting of God WM neither Evfll, nor tending to Evill.

26. A third tempting did follow thefc : namely of Man towards God , wherein he did in a ccrtainemannermakc triall of the truth and Grace of God : namely making triall, whether God would preftrve him,although he did not cleave to himjOr whether he would certainly doe what he had threatncd.

27. A fourth temptation of Eve did accompany that, namely towards her felfe 3 whereby (he received the tentation or (uggeftion oi the Dcvill^into her felfejand applied to her felfe to her own ruine.

28. From that arofe a fifth, whereby the Woman ferving the Divcli, as his inftrumentdid tempt ^dam : and from that proceeded a fixeh^whereby A^/^»? tempted himfelfe,whilft he conftnted with a ccrtaine purpofe to the Woman , and the Devill.

2 9. Either all or moft of thefc tentations are found alfo in every Mans fins, i

30. And fo that fin was confiimmated, as touchingthrf Tall of Man-kind in j^dam^for ^^*«»^ was properly the be*, ginning of Man-kind, not Evt» Unlefle as (he was madc^ for him, and with him^did make one and the fame begin-ning.Hence it is that we read in Scripture of a fecond ^dam^ but not of a fecond Eve,

64 From this guiltinefle there foUoweth a confcience altogether evill ; namely accufing and condemning juftly. And hence followes horrour,and flying from the prefence of Godt

12. It is faid to be an evill inflifted , not fimply con-traded 5 becaufe it pcrtaines to rewarding and revenging Juftice.

13. It is faid to be inflided for «y/;^^<? 5 becaufe it hath al* wayes refpeft and order to the defart of the Sinne ^ unto which puni(hn)ent foUowes from the offence, by reafon of the prohibition^ and from the guiltineflc , by reafon of the commination.

14. Therefore punilliment properly fo called ^ hath no place but in Intelligent Creatures , in whom alfo Sinne found.

15. Becaufe Sinne is reduced into order by punifhment^and Sin in it felfe is in fomc meafure againft the goodneflc of God, but puniffiment only againft the good of the Creature : thsrci-fore Sin hath more evill in it fclfc then punifliment.

36. By this loflTe of grace, man is robbed of all (aving gifts: andfonatureisweakned, put out of order, and as it were wounded. ^

37. The beginning of fpirituall death in matter of fencc^is fpirituall bondage.

2. The canfe of this reftoring was the mcrcifnll purpoft of

God. £pkug. According to his free good will which hce

had purpofcd in h(nv(clfe. For there was nothing in man^

which could confer any force to procure this reftoring :

but rather much which made to the contrary, as fin, in which

there was an enmity againft God : which in that refpeft

^ doth commend this love of God towards us. Rom.'y^S.But

God commends his love towards us^in that when we were yec

finners,Chrift died for us.

3 There arc two parts of this reftoring : Redemption, and the application thereof. That is as ic were the firft aft of this reftoring: this as it were the fecond aft. That is as it Were the matter , this as it were the forme of our falva-tion. That is as it were the Sufficiency , this the very Efficiency*

4. Thefe parts are altogether ofoneand the fame latitude.

or the end of redemption is the application of it : and

k prime reafon, rule, and meafure of application is that

«^e gracious Will of God which was the caufe of Redem*

pfcn it fclfc. Eph. I • p. 10* He hath made knowne to «s,thc

m^ery of hi^will, according tJ his free good will, which

he lad foreordained in himfelfc, that in the full difpenfati-

i^.IntheperfonofChrifl the Mediator two things acta be obferved: the diftinftion,of the two natures,and the perfo-' nail union of them.



Theferfm&fCbriJi. . 7^

14. ThediftirxS natures arc : the Divine nature, as it is rheleco.id pcrfon of the Deity, and the humane, in all things l:ke to our natures ( excepting finne ^ and the manner of (Iibifting) cyI^iM.23. £ma»ue/,God with us, lohn i. 14. That word was mide flefh, &c. The diftinftioo it (clfebctweenechole two natures rcmaines : becaufechey re-maiiic abfolutely the fame which they were before ^ as well touching thei cffcnct as all thcireflcntiall properties : Hence neither the Djicy in Gfirift with the humanity, nor the humanity with the deity is cither changed, or mingledjOr any Way confounded*





15. The perlbnall union , is that whereby the ftcond pcrfonofthe deity did take the humane nature, that it might infcparably fublift in the Um^pcrConfohm.i/^.

id For the iecoad perfon of the deity although it have but one (ubfiftence^yet it hath a twofold way of fubfiftmg: one in the Divine nature fran eternity, another in the humane nature rtfter the incarntiont Rom.9. 5. Of whom is Chriff, as touching the fle(h, who is above all, G^dblefledfor cver^ Amen. Which latter way of fubfifting doth agree to the Son of God, inrcfpeft of the union which he hath with the hu-^mane nature.

17- This union to the divine pcrfon and nature, doth ad nothing, butacertaine relation : but in the humane nature itraakech a change, whilll by this meanes it is elevated to higheft perfeiftion: for ic is made as it were a proper adjunft of the Divine pcrfon by which it isafllimed : as it were a member of the fame whole G jd man* e-^^^ ^ttUx whereof tir: divine nature is as it were another part : as touching the fiibfiftcnce, it is m^deasit wereancfFeft Angularly upheld by the Divine nature : and aKoitis made as it were a fub-jeft wherein the Divine nature doth efpecially dwell. CoU. 2. ^,

18i Wee endeavour to defcribe this union, by many logi-call waycs : becaufe it cannot fufficiently be explained by any one.

19* We ufe all thoft terraes wherein the fountaines of con-fent, and unity are containcdj that we may (hew the union to be moftrnfere.



20. Yet wee temper thefcternrics with that limitation, as it were, becaufc this union is myfticalJ,attd ftcret,(e as it may not be plainly cxprcflTed , but oncly (hadowed forth by humane words, and notions.

21. From this union there foUoweth a perfonall communication of properties : which is not a reall transfufion. For then the Divine nature (hould take the properties of the humane, and the humane fhould take the properties of the Divine, and fo the humane (hould be the Divine, and the Divine, the humane,or as well the Divine, as humane (hould ceafe to be* Neither is it a reall donation from which ftould follow, that the humane nature might u(e the Divine properties as its own inftruments. But it is a Communion, or concurring unto the fame operations 5 fo that they are performed together by each nature, but according to their own diftinft properties.

32. Hence it comes to pafle that all the doings and foffir-

ings ofChrift arc referred properly to his perfon as the proper

Terminum^ bound ofthem : although fome are properly to be

referred to the one,{bme to the other nature, as to their begin-

' ning,and proper refpeftst

13. And hence followcth the Communication of thefe V properties, as touching predication, or attribution, where- \ by the properties of the one nature are attributed either to I the whole perfon, as when Chrift is laid to be dead which is proper to the humane nature, and to have becne in the beginning which is proper to the Divine nature; Or to the other nature, becauft of the perfon,as when Godisfaidto be taken up into glory; I'tim.i. 16. To be crucified^ r Cor. 2.8^ Which doe not properly.agree to the Divine nature,but to the humane. And thole things which are proper to the whole perfon, are properly attributed to cither nature: as when the man Chrift is laid to be the Mediator betwixt God and man. i Tim.2.%* Which doth not agree to Chrift as hec is man,but as he is God and man.

24. But jis that Communion doth properly relpcft the perfon ofChrift^not the natures confidcred in thcmfclves, fo thatcommunicationwhichconfifts in predication doth reft peft God^or man in the concrete,not the Deity, or humanity in the abftraftc 2 5»Thcre-



25. Therefore the conimunicaiion of properties is not mecrcly verball, neither yet is it fo reall that the property of one nature doth pafle in the other as touching the intrinfe-call poflTeflion and ufiirpation.

26. Thofe examples which arc wont to be brougTit ofthoft that thinke the contrary of that communication which is betweenc the matter and the forme , betweene the (bulc and the body^and betweene Iron and the fire^doe neither agree to this miftery, nor prove the pofition it felfe.

27. There were in Chrift twounderftandings rone Divine, whereby he knew all things, lohn 21.17. ^"^ ^^^ other humane, whereby he knew not (bmethings as yet. Marl^^^.^z. Alfo there were two wilk, one divine Luke^. ij. And the other humane^ together alfo with a naturall appetitCj ^hu 26.39. So there is a double prefence of Chrift: but yet the humane prcftncc, can neither be every where, nor in many places at once*

28.Becau(eGodinChri^,God-man , hath reftored life to uSjtherefore our Faith is carried 0 wards Chrift,and by Chrift toward God»

Of SatisfaBiofi.

.j^rTT^Here be two parts of redemption : the humiliation I of Chrift as our Mediator, and his exaltation. X^ 2. Hiimiliacion is that whereby he is (ubjcft cc the juftice /&£ God ^ to pcrforme all thoft things which were required to the redemption of man. PhiL 2.8. Being found in fliape as a man, he humbled himfelfc and became 6* bedicnt unco death.

3. This humiliation was not properly of the Divine na* turc or perfon 5 confidered in it felfe, but of the Media,tor God-man.

4. Therefore the taking of the humane mturejConfidered fimply & in it fclfe is not a part of this humiliation :becau(e it was the aftipn of God only: but that condition of a fcrvant, which did accompany the taking of the Divine nature ^ w?s the prime 2|nd proper reafon of the humiliation ^ Yet in re- ^ fpeftof this condition^by a relation redounding from thence, the Divine perfon is rightly faid to be of no reputation. ThiUi.j. Bccaufeitdid exift in that forme , which for a time Was void of all glory and Divine Majefty :jfor the Divine Majeity did fupprcfle and hide it (elfethroughqiit all that fpace of humiliacion; that it did not conftantly exer-cifc that diguity which did afterward appeare in the exaltation^ rj.iu/i twi.

7.1t is the fame alfo which is fignificd where it is faid 5 he was made finnc for u?. i(^or.\. 21. For he could no other way be made nnne then either by inward pollution ^ or outward reputation: but he was mod ofall free from pollution: neither did the imputationoffinany other way agree to him then that hce might for us undergoe the punifhracnt due tofinne.

8. In the fame rcfpeiflit is faid thathe bore our iniquities, Ifnj. 53. 4. Neither doth that phraife fignifie a bearing of patience: for by bearing he toofce away the fins of the world. John 1.19 Ndther doth it only de<:Iare a power of taking a-' way fins: for he bore our fins in his body upon the Croffc. I Tet.2 34.

9. The like force is of that forme he paid the price of redemption for U5. Mat. 20. 28. For neither is there a mecre deliveringfetforth by that phraife, noreveryineanesofit; becaufe the pcice it (elte is nonfiinated, and it is intimated to be of the like common rcfpcft withthepaimcntoffilveror gold for vendible merchandize.

12.1n the fame humiliation of Chrift thtrc was alfo^ merit, as it is ordered to our benefit J or to obcainc feme good for us in the way of reward. This is (hewed in all thofc places of Scripture wherein he is faid by his obedience to have procured rightcoufncfle form. Ronr.^.i^. Many are made righteous ; to procure the favour of God for us.

13. The merit and fatisfafiion of Chrift dtfFernot in the thing it felfe , fo as they ftiould be Cought for in fundry and different operations ; but they ought J n a divcrfe way to be acknowledged in one and the fome obedience.

14. Neither ought any part of that obedience which is foundin the humiliation ofChrift^to be excluded from that dignity and u(co

i5^.6ut the exaltation of Chrift^although it be an eflentiall part of his mediation^ yet it doth not pertaine to his merir^or iatisfa£tion.

I d. This Satisfaftion as touching the (ubftancc of thc^^ thing was perfeft, in rigour of juftice; yetitpreliippoleth^V grace, whereby Chrift was called to performe this worke^ and whereby it being performed, it was accepted in our name and for our good.* Laftly^ whereby that is performed by covenant rewarding which was required in this Satisfafti-on.

3, Unto his copecpticn there were two principles that did \y, orkc together pne aftivc^ and another palTnre* * 4. The Pailivc was the blelied K/V^i^ Utfarj : which is called a paflive principle, not becaufe (he did nothing unto the bringing forth of Chrift, but becaufe (he did nothing of her felfe^but that (he did adminiftcr that matter of which thefle{hofChrift\;7as formed. Neither yet could ftie admi-nifter it immediacy fit, ( for (he had no pure matter j but it was made fit by a certaine fupernaturall preparation, and lancflification. Z^i'.i.35. Becaufe that which fhall be borne of thee is holy 3 yet Chrift was truly and really the Sonne olMary^^nd the feed ofthe Woman promifed from the be^ ginning.Neithcr are there therefore two Son-ftiips in Chrift really diftinft , or two fonnes joyncd together 5 for that tcmporall Son-Qiip, whereby he is referred to his Mother, was a refpedl of reafon only. Indeed the humane nature of thrift had a reall relation to Mary ^ as to a caufe , but the Son-fhip doth no way agcec to the naoire, but to the perfon only : yet there is that relation of the humane nature to the pcr^n^andofiliiir; to that nature, that it may be truly and rightly laid, Marj was the Mother of God#

5. The aftive principle of this conception was not a mm (whence^ Welled cJtfigry was a Mother and Virgin together. Mit:*i.2^. Ifayy.14. ) But the holy Spirit. Neither yctcao Chrift he calkd the Stoonc ofthe holy Spirit, no not in as much as he is maQ ^ jfbras he is oian, neither is he of the fame nature with the holy Spirit, neither doth it agree to a nature 3 but to a perioa to iindergoe -the rcfpeft of a Sbnncci

8. In the birth of Chrift there was humility of grcatcft poverty with an atteftation of gratcft glory : that both natures, and both parts of mediation, might be declaredirora the beginning.

9. All the earthly things which did belong to the birth of Chrift were moft humble : But the Angels and Starrca of Heaven did declare that glory wherewith all kinds of men, Shepheards, wifenenj Herod^ and the Priefti with aH the people were moved.Z^r. It 18. J[/^r.2.a,3.

10. By reafon of this birch he was according to the flefli the Sonne of the P^tfrrVcA^i'of all the world, yet fpecially he was that feed oi^hraham^m whom all Nations (hould be blefled 5 and that Sonne of David who was to pofleflc a Kingdomc^not of this,but of another for ever.

i4.In his private life, there was his infancy and fobjeftion CO his parents*

15.1n his infancy there was his. i. Circumciiion and offering. 2.His flight unto JE/jpfj and returning thence.

^6. Chrift was circumcifed andoflfered, becanfe he did {\hysiik himfelfe not only to the eternall and morall Law^ but alfo to the CcremonialI,and every Law of God.

17. Thofc ceremonial! obfervations ^ were fo many ccHi*' feffions of finnc. Therefore Chrift who was madefin iov u«i was fitly made conformable to them.

i8. Alfo they were certaine outward meanes belonging



OftkLffe^fChrift. to ravine worfhip : thire^fope Chrift ebftrwd thcm^thathe might fulfill all rightcoUfneflTc.

19. L^ftly 3 they were certainc types fhadowing forth Chiiit: now that he might fulfill thofc, and by this meanes fanftific the fame,he would apply them to himlelfc.

20f Circumcifion was the;Seale of the Covenant of God.

21. Offering was a prefcnting and dedicating the firft born unto God : therefore Chrift was fitly both circumcifed a;nd offered, becaufe hee was to confirme chat faving Co-vetoant by his blood, and among the firft borne , hee was oncly perfeftly holy to Godj of whom all others were only types.

2XHis flight Into JE/j/>f,andhis remrnethence,was,i.That he might fhcw from the beginning of hii agc^ that ke was borne to undergo^ ttiiftry. 2, That according to the condition to which he had fubmitted hira(elfe,fae might ipfoYide for his life attcr the manner of men#3.That he might withal (hew,thal he wac the manjthat (hould bring us out of Ipirituall £fjpt in^ Cothe promifed Land.

Becaufe there is the (amc rcafon of one precept* as of all. 2.

24. Although that this legall obedience Was required of Ghrift now made man by right, of Creation, yet becaufe he wai made man^not for himfclfc,bat for us, it was a part of that Homiliation^tisfacf^oi^ andimecii^whidvGod required, and accepted of him for us* h >. 1^^ "L f j in: i^> r 'li,5 •orti i ' 25« In this (ubjeftion thcfe two things are to be observed* The exception which hee did fuffer ^ and the cffcft which it did bring forth*

26m The exception was the disputation which he hadwith theScribeSjWhen he was b«c twelve yearcs oidf

27. This difputation was a foregoing tcftimony, of thai publick calling whereby he was ordained and (enttabea roafter and uacher oilfrAd^ ^8. Tf



2*. Ic was alfo to teach , that that knowledge and wifcdome wherewith Chrift was endued^ was not gotten, by progrcflc of time, but conferred or infufed of God from the beginning.

29. ThcefFcdlofthls ftibjeftion was his labouring with his hands, that is, an enduring of that cune of ours, whereby it comes to paflc that we eat our bread with that labour inthefweatofthe face.

30. Hi' publique life is that whereby he openly manifefted himfclfe to be the Mcjfias. In this life, there was^ i. Thecn-terance. 2. The progrefle. 3* The conclufion.

31. Unto the entrance percaines his Baptiime and Ten-Cation*

32. The BaptiCne of Chrift was his publick inauguration to the publick performance of his office: therefore in it , the three offices of Chrift are affirmed^an J coafirmed.

3> They are affirmed by the teftimony ofthe father pub-lickcly pronouncing that Jefiis Chrift is his Sonne 5 and fo that he is appointed a King by him^ even that King in whojn he is well pleafed, that is, achiefe Prieft^ who by his in-terceffion (hould take away the (ins of the World, and a chiefe Prophcto'L^^^5,i7.& J7.3,Thisismy Sonne in whom I am well pleafed^heare him.

34. The fame offices are confirmed by fignes: namely,by opening of Heaven, defcending of the holy Spirit under the bodily ftiape of a Dove ^ rcftmg upon Chriftj and an audible voycc fent downe from HeaveUjWhereby the teftiniony of the Father was Hgnified.

35. They were alfo confirmed by the teftimony oijoh>2 who Wis appointed J for a witneflc , preacher, and forerunner of Chnftj and being certified of Chrift partly by the revelation ot the Spirit^^nd partly by thoie fignes before men-tionei.he did teftihc of him before othtrs.

5p,The poverty of Chtift was without a Hngular vow, aiid without bcggery.

40. The labour ofChrift was in travailing through divers Countries, in watchings, and in grcatcft intention of all his ftrcpgch to doe good.

4i.x.This publique life of Ghrift was performed in preaching 5 and working miracles 5 unto the preaching ofChrift was alwayes joynedg in refpeft of himftlfc^ grace and au-thority* Inrefpcft of others either opening, or hardening of heart.

5.But becaufc there wa^ in this death the cotjfummation of all humiliation , whereof that alfo was the far grcatcft part: hence often in Scriptures by a Syncchdochc df the member, the death it felfe of Chrift is put for all that fatisfaftion which is contaioed in his whole humiliation.

6. Thefe limkations being had ^ this death of Chrift was the fame in kind and proportion with that death which in juftice was due to the fins of men reprcfenting the very fame degrecSimembcrs^and kinds*

7. The beginning of the fpirituall death of Chrift in matter of loffc, was the loofing of that .oy and delight, which the enjoyment of God, and fulnefle of giace was wont to bring. But he did loofe this fpirituall joy, not as touching the principle and habit of ic^ but as to the ad and fence of if*

8. The beginning of fpiritmll death in matter of fence, was the tafting of the wrath of God , and a ccrtainc (ubjefti-on to the power of darkenefle- But that wrath of God was moft properly that Cup which was given to Chrift to be Dtunkc.Mat.26.^9. My Father, it it be poffible , let thii Cup paflefromme*

5>. But the object of this anger was Chrift ^not abfblutly, but only as touching the puniflimcnt which is brought by this anger,which he as our furety did undergoc.

I o. That fubjcftion to the power of darkeneffe was noc to bondage ^ but to vexalion, which Chrift did fcele in his mind.

ii.From theft the foule of Chrift was afFeSed with forrow, gxiefe^fearcjand horror,in an agony. Mat.26.^9. John 12.27. Heh^^.j.Lfic.2 2.24.

I2.1n this manner was the (bule of Chrift afFefted not only in that part which (bme call the inferior, but alfo in the fupcrior part / not only nor chiefly out of a fellow-feeling which ic had with the body, but properly and immediatly: nor chiefly out of compaffion which it had in refpeft of o-thers, but out of a proper fuffcring^ which it didundcrgoc



in QUr^iamc. Laftly,not out of an horror of tcmporaJl death, which many of Chrifts (ervant^ alfo have by his power over* comc,but ouc of a cercaine fence of a (upernaturall and Ipiri* Uidl death.

13* Thercwcre two cfFcfts of this agony. Firft, a vehement deprecation (hewing a mind aliunilhcd and a nature flying from the bitterneire of death , yet under condition, and with fubjeftion to his Fathers will. Ma>c. 14.35. He prayed that if it might 'be that houre might p?ffe from him. Iohn^i2.2j. My foule is troubled ^ and what (h.ill I fay ? Father keepe me from this houre: but therefore came I untc this houre. Secondly, a watery fweat having clutters of blood mixed with it dropping downeto the ground, Luc.ir.^^ Being in an agony he prayed moFe earneftly. And hii iweat was like drops of blood falling downe to the ground.

^^ In this beginning of fpiriruali death there was a cer-taine moderation, and mitigation 5 that in the meane while there might be place for thole duties which were to be fini-{hedbefore,hisdeath,namelyprayer85 conferences, admonitions, anlweres.

15.This moderation was inward or outward. . 16. The inward was by fpaces of time upon the flacking of the prcflure and vexation which he did feele in his ioule. Hence in his underflanding he did attend unto the courft of his ofiicc undertaken, to the glory that would thence arife to his Father, and to himfelfe, and to the falvation of thoft whom his Father had given to him. In his will alfo hee did chufe and enibrace all the miferies of death to obtainc thole ends.

. 17. The outward mitigation of this death was by an An-gcll who did ftrengthen him in talking withhim. L/rr*22. 43. And appeared to him an Angell from Heaven comforting him.

1?. There was no inward beginning of the bodily death of Chrift befidcs that natural! mortality and weakening which the outward force did bring.

ip.The externall beginning was manifoldjboth in matter of loflcjand matter of ftnce.

Fourthly, in working^whip-ping^and crucifying,with reproches^ and injuries of all kinds joyned with them. Yec there was fome mitigation of this death. Firft,by manifeftationof the Divine Majefty, to the working of certaine miracles : as in cafting the Souldiers downe to the ground with his (ighc and voyce, and inheal-itig the earc oiMalchtis. Secondly, by operation of the Divine providence, whereby it came to paffe^ that he was jufti-ficd by the Judge,before he wascondcmned.2W^r.29.24. lam innoctnt ^fthe blood of thisjnfi man.

Of the Exaltation of ^hrifi*

j,rTn»He Exaltation of Chrift is that whereby hce did I glorioufly triumph over his and our enemies. Lnc. X 24. 26. Ought not Chriil to have fuffcred thefc things, and fo to enter into glory ? Eph.^^S. When he afccn-ded up on high, hcled captivity capttve.Ci?/. 2.15. He hath (polled principalities and powers, and hath made ajfliewof them openly^and hath triumphed over them in it*

t. He overcame death by enduring it, finne by fatisfying, the Dcvill by fpoiling him , or taking the prey out of his hands*

3. The perfeftion and manifeftation of this viftory is in his Exaltation. Therefore although there was a virtuall triumph, and triumph of merit in his death, and in the Croflc, in which Chrift is faid to be exalted, or extolled^ Iffhf 3.14* Not in iituation and place only^ but alio in v^me^md merit:

N 2 yet



of the Exaltation ofChri(L yet the aftuall triumph as touching the Rate of it, was not in his humiliation,but his Exaltation.

4.Ghrift did triumph in the Croffe, as in a Field o f vifto-ry; but in his Exaltation, as in the kingly feat, and Ghaiiot of triumph.

5 .The glory of thif triumph was^a changing of the hamble forme of a fervant, and that mod abjed condition which inithedidundergoe, intoblcflcdneflTej altogether Heavenly. TiiA a. p» Wherefore alfo God did highly eKdkbim, and gave him a name above every name.

6. Inrefpeft of the Divine nature, it wasonely ana<5ive manifeftation ; li rcfpeft of the humane nature , it was a reall receiving with fatable a<Sions flowing from itr-

y.The humane nature received all thofe perfedions,which a created nature could take.Fcr in the foulc there flouri(hed all kind of fulnefl'e of wifdome and grace, not onlyinrefpeft of the principle and habit, but allb in refpeft of the aft and exercile : his body alfo was adorned with grcatcft purity, agilityjfplendorjand ftrength. Hehr.i2.2» For the joy that was (et before him, heenduned theCroficj P/^Z/.j. 21. Who (hall transforme our^ile body^that it may be life to his glori' onsbody,

8, Butasthefoule of Chrift being now exalted, didfiill retaine the nature of a foule , fo alfo the body glorified did in no wife lay downe the effcnce, and eflentiall properties of a body : therefore it can neither be every where, nor together in nwny places, nor in the fame place with another body Penetrative. Which indeed all that have eyes to (ee may cleerly perceive in thofe phrafcs of Scripture. Being taken from them he was caried up into Heaven. Luke 24.51. He is not here,he is viCeti^Mar.22.6' And many uich like.

9. There were three degrees of Exaltation oppofite to as many degrees of his extreame humiHarion : namely his R^-(uireftio from thedead>eingoppo(cdto his deathjhisafcen-ding into Heaven oppofed to his defcending into the Grave^ and to the loweft place of the Earth 5 and his (itting at tfce rjght Hand of God oppofed to his remaining in the GrAvC;> axid in the ftace of death or in Hell.

11. The fbuk is faid improperly to have riferragaine t but the body and humane nature properly. For the body, and the man , did properly recover his perfcftion : but the Ibule did recover the aft^ and nootion of its perfeftion in the body,

IT. There arc two parts of his Refurrc&ionj the firft is an internall aft, namely a reviving reftored, by the uniting of foale and boiy : the (econd is an extcrnall aft, namely his going ouc of the Grave to the manifeftation of li^ reftored,

15. Unto this Refurre.ftion there did give teftimony. i; th« Angclls. 2. Chrift himfelfe by divers apparitions ( ten whereof at leaft are reckoned up in the Scriptures ) and alfo bydtvers proofcs taken out of the Scriptures* 3*Mtn;whio were certified of it by fecing^hearing, and handling him.

17. For Chrift as God is the caufeabfolutcly principal] ofourR*e(Lirreftion:as fatisfying by his humiliationjand death be is the meritorious caufe : but as rifing from the dead he is the exemplary caufe , and withall a demonftration and an initiation.

i8. Theafcendingof Chrift intoHeavcn^ isamiddlede-gree, or rertaine progreflTe of exaltation , whereby leaving the Earth he afccctfls up into the higheft Heaven as into his throne of glory. <iAfls i.ii. He is talcen up from you into Heaven 9 Ephef. 4. 10. Hcc afcended farre above all Heavens.

j9.This afcenfion was of the whole perfon; yet it doth noc agree to the Divine nature, but figuratively, namely as it was the caufc of afcending ^ and was joyncd with the humane nature, in excellency : manifcfting alfo his glory in it^where-ofhe had as it were emptied himlclfe^when he defended into it by the incarnation : but it doth moft properly agree to the humane nature J becaufe it fuffered cnange from a lower placetoanhighcr^

zo.Thc time of his afcenfion was 40 dayes after hts Refur-reftion JBsi,^. notfooner : becaufe the infirmity of the Difciples did require the delay of this fpace of time^ihat their faith might be confirmed by divers appearings, and they might alfo be more fidly inftrufted in thofe things which per-tainetotheKingdomeofOodt ABsi.^.

2 5.The caufe of this afcenfion was the fame which before was of the Rcfurrc(!1:ion : namely the power of God^whkh is the (ame both of the Father and the Son :hence in refpeft of the Father it is called an afllmiption which in refpeft of the Son is called an afceijfion.^^i^. I.I i.Biit there was added more-over the condition of a glorified body; which is carried as well upward as doivnward.

26. The ends of his afcenfion were. i. That he might place his humane nature now glorified in the manfion of glory, 2.

17. Sitting ac the right Hand of God is the higheft degree of his Exaltation, whereby heenjoycth the higheft glo^y of bis mediation. Hence Refurreftion, and Alcention arc (notions tending to this fitting : hence alio Rcfurreftion and Alcenii-^n in a certaine manner common tons with Chrift j but fitting at the right hand of the Father agrees to none,buc toChrift only.

30.This majefty and power doth properly agree to the per-(on of Chrift the Mediator : in refpcft of which it is alio truly faid that the humane nature of Chrift hath now fo mu/:h^minency of dignity and ruledome 5 that with power he is above 3 and fet over all created things Epha^ 20* But from this eminency of dignity 5 to conclude that the hu mane nature of Chrift ( which was created and remaines finite ) being abfblutely and abflradedly confidcred^hath the fame omnipotcncy^and omnipre(ency withGod himlelfcit is iio other thing then a certaine ftupid madneflc^ anditis.not iar from blafphcmy.

4. Hence our deliverance from finne and death ^ was not oncly determined in the decree of God, but alfo granted^and communicated to Chrift, and to us in him, before it be perceived by us. Rom.% .10.11. We were reconciled to God, by the death of his Son. By whom we have now received a reconciliation.

!• Tr\Ecaufe this application of redemption is made to |%romecertainemen, andnottoalljfothat itftieweth jLJ A manifeft difference betweene men, in refpeft of the di(pcnfation of grace ; hence it doth make the preiefti-natiori of God concerning men appearc to us in the fir ft place.:

, 2f Predeftination indeed was from eternity 5 £ph.\. 4, He hath chofen us before the foundations of the World were Uidr 2. Tf>i».x.9^ Which grace was given us before allages# And it did alfo worke from the beginning of the workcs of God : but it makes no inwarddifFerencein the Predeftiriate t-hemfelvcs before the a(ftuali difpenfation of this applicati-6ri» jfipfc.2.3# And we were by nature the children of wrath as wcUas others* i Cor.6m\\. Thus yee were indeed. For Predeftination before the application of grace doth put nothing in the pcrfons Predeftinated^but it doth lie hid only in him that doth predeftinate.

^. This Predeftination is the decree of God of manifeft-ing his fpeciall glory in the eternall condition of men* Rom. jl.21^2^. Willing ta(bcWchi^^wrathandtomakchispower .-pi : O 3 knowne

4. Iciscallcddeftination cbecaufeit is a ccrtainc determination of the order of raeanes unto the end. But becaufe God had determined this order with himfelfe, before any aAualt cxiftencc oi things, therefore it is not fimply called dcftina-tion,but predeftjnation* ^

$. It is called a decree: becaufe it containes a definite (en-t^jncc to be executed by certaine counfell. In the fame fence alfo it it called a purpofe, and counfell, becaufe it propounds an end to be attained unto, as it were with an advifed deliberation.

6.Hence predeftination hath grcatcft wifdomc, frcedomc, firmencflCj and immutability joyned with it: becaufe tbefeare found in all the decrees of God.

7, Therefore the realbn of Predeftination is unmoveablc, and indiflTolublCj 2 7Vw,2# i p. The foundation of God ftand« etb (lire having this feale. The Lord knoweth who are his. And under that refpeft the number of the predeftinatcd, ^ not only the formall number , or number numbering ^as they %cake ) that is, how many men at length fliall be (aved, and how many not; but alfo the materiall number or number numbredj that is, who thofe feverall men arc ) is certaine with God, not only by certainty of foreknowlcdge^but alio by certainty of order of meanes.Z^aio.ao.Rejoycc that your names are written in the Heavens*

8. For Predeftination doth not neceflarily prciuppofe either its limit^or objeft as exiftlng^but itmakech it to exift: I0 that by force of predeftination it is ordered^ that it (hould ht.\,?eui.20.0flhrijl forehjtorpm before thefonndations of the world were laid.

9. Hmce alfo it depends upon no caufe/reafon orout^ ward condition, but it doth purely proceed from the will of himthatpredeftinateth. LMat.11.26. Even (b Fatherjbc-caufe it pleafed thee. Rom.^.i6.i%. It is not of him that willetb, nocjof him that runneth ^ but of God that fheweth ;. * ' mercy:

to. Hence it is neither neccflary nor agreeable to the Scriptures either to appoint any fore-required quality in man, as it were the formal] objeft of Predeftination : or foto.;(Iigne any certaine condition of man ^ that the reft (hould be excluded :forit is fufficient touoderftand that menaretheobjccl of this dccrte,(b that the diiFcrencc of the decree doth not depend upon man, but that difference^ which is found in men, doth follow upon the decree.

ii.In order of intention there is no forc-knowledgc>fore-re-quircdjOr ought to be prefuppoi^ unto the decree of Predefti-natioHsbefidee that fimple intelligence which is of all polTible things : becau(e it depends not upoii any reafon, or cternall condition 5 but doth purely proceed from the will of him that doth prcdeftinate. Eph.i.^.p. He hath predeftinatcd u$ according to the good pleafurc of his owne will. According to bis free good will which he had purpoftd in himfi-lfe.

12. It is properly an a(ft of Gods Will whereby it is cxer-cifcd about a cwtaine obje(5k which ic determines to britig to a certaine end by certaine meanes. Efh.i.ii* We were chofcn,when we wercprcdeftinaCed,according to the purpofe of him that workcthalhhings according to the pleafurcof his own wil!#

13. This decree as ic doth exift in the mind of God prc-fuppofing an aft of the will is called fore-knowledge: whence it comes to pafle that forc-kno^vledgc fignifics as much (bmetime as Predeftination 5 but lefTc properly ^ Romans I It 2. Hee hath not caft away his people whom hec fore-l$n€w.

14. There is only one a6lofwilI in God properly jbecauft all ^ings in hkn are together , and nothing before or after^ and fo there is oiiiy one dea«e about the end and mcanes: but after our manner of conceiving , God in order of intention doth will the end before the meanes. Ro/k.^.^o. Whom hehathpredeftinatedj thofc he called : although in€)rderof execution 5 he willcth the mcanes firft before their direftion totheend% 2 Thef.2. 13.

15. Some things are the ireanes, and the end , and the cauiesalfoofothdrmeanes. M^ 6.37, Whatfoevef the Father givcth me (hall come to me, and him that ccmmcth tome I will in no wife caft away, yet they are not caufes of the ad ic fclfe of Predeftination, nor of all the cffe6ls of ic.

i6i There are feme meancs which oftheir own nature are ordered to the end of Predeftination : of which fort are all thofe things which pertaine to the grace revealed in the Gof-pell 5 but other things in a certaine outward refpeft arc fubje^ted to this order: fuch as are naturall good orcvill things which above or beyond their nature through the over-ruling dircftion of grace doe workc together to our falvation.

17. OfPrcdeftination there are two kindcs, Eleftionand Reprobation.

18. Eleftion is the predeftination of fome certaine men, that the glorious grace of God may be manifefted in them* £^^.1.4,5,6.Hehathchofen u8, he hathpredcftinatcdusto the praifc of his glorious grace.

i9.Ele£tionisana(5^ofthewill, which in God is only one and fimple :y et after cur manner of conceiving ic fees forth(by Synecdoche) by divers aft«.

21. The (eeond aft Is to appoint (bme certaine men who (hal be made partakers of this falvation.i«T/w»2.i9.The Lord knoweth who are hif.

EfL%.2^. 3^ Love with a feparatingfrom others: in which comparative manner, there i^ contained a certaine virtuall intention of love* Rem. 9.15,

24. This third aft m a fpccrall rcfpeft is called prcdeftf-nation : which is fometirac in the Scriptures diitinguiftcd from cleftion^vcn as it reipefts the cleft above, R^rt^S.iy. Epki 4.&5. Whom he did fore-know, thofe hcallopiecic-ftinated* As he hath chofen us. Who hath prcdtltinated nu Although otherwifcbya fynecdochc it is uicd in the fame fence with eleftion, •i^'

25. Hence Prcdeftination is fomerime faid to.be according to his purpofc. Eph.iAh And his purpofc according to eleftion, Rcm.^. 11. And eleftion alfo according to purpofc, thecounfell, and goodplcafurc of the WillofGod, EphA.%.

16. There doth a certaine knowledge particularly accompany theft afts of will in eleftion in the mind of God, whereby God doth moft certainly know the heiresof et^rnail life : whence alfo eleftion it ftlfe is called > knowledge or foreknowledge. Rom. 8.29. But this knowledge ofGodbecauft with greateft firmn^flfe it retaines the diftinft names of thofe that are to be faved, .and the good things appoioted for them, as if all were written in Gods Booke, therefore it is called the booke of Life.

This eleftion was ojily one in God in refpeft of whole Chriftmyfticailyconfidered, thatiSjofChtift, andofthoft who are in Chrift, as there was one Creation o^f ail mankind ;yet as a certaine diftin^ftion may beconceived according to reafoUjChrift was firft clefted as the Head, and then (omc men as in embers in him. f)?^.

28. YecChrift is not the meritorious, or impulfivecauft in refpeft of the eleftion of men it lelfe , although it hath the reafon of a caufe in refpeft of all the cffi^fts of of eleftion, which follow the fending of Chrift him* ielfc.

29. Chrift kimfclfe in the firft aft of eleftion as touching the wbrkc of redemption is rightly (aid to be an cffcft, and meanes ordained to th^jEalvation of man, as the end ^ as this

3a.The firft a^lis to Will the ietting forth of Juftice.Thcre-fore the end of God in reprobation, is not properly the de-ftruiiionot tbeCrfature^but the Juftice ^fGod,wfa£:h (bines forth in deformed deftrudtion.

33. Hence is the firft difference in reafbn betwecne eleftion and reprobation 5 for in eledion not only the glorious grace of G6d b^thtber€fpcftofanend:butaIfo theialvattonof men themfelves: but in reprobation damnaticm in it felfe hath notthcrefpccflofknend, orofgood. '^ t : ..; :

34. The fecond aft is to appoint thoft certaine men in whom this Juftice of G o d ftiould be made manifeft. Jnie 4. . ^

^5. Thataftcannot^properly becalled eleftion : becaufe itisnot^rtdfUovejneither doth it biding the beftowing of any good, but the privation of it : Therefore it is properly called reprobation, becanft it doth rejeft or remove thole aboutwhomitis exerciXcdj from that love wherewith the cleft are appointed to (alvation* As therefore in eleftion^ therei^dovewithdifcerningfo in reprobation there is fecne the dentall of love with putting a difference.

36. But bccaufe this negative fctting apart which is fctind in reprobation, dpth depend upon that(cttingapart::iwhich is in eleftion : hence the remote end of reprobation is: the glory of that grace which il^mianiFefted in ekftion..ffi2>^. 5^22, aj.He (fifferedthdveflck Qfl«7rath,thattiemighrmake known the riches of hi^ glory toward the stSAz of mercy*

40.

•a. This comrnunion therefore doth bring a tranflation and change of condition to believers, from the ftatc of fin and death, to the ftate of righteoufnefle and life eternall. I lohn 3** 14* Wc know that we aretranflatcd from death to lift. rii>ii/:n^iflv;'^

5/ This change of ftatc is twofold 5 relative, and abfolutc or reall.

4, A relative change of ftate is that which confifts in Gods reputation. Rom*^,%. And hethat worketh not,but believeth in bifm that juftifieth the ungodly, his faith is imputed to him for righteoufiieflcji C^r.^^li^ God was in Chrift reconciling the World to himiclfe : not imputing to them their

offences* '

5, Hence it admits no decrees ptoperly 10 Called, but it is together and at once perfeft in one only aft, although in refpcft of the manifeftation. fence, and effefts^ it hath divers degrecs.Hitherto pertaines juftification and adoption.

60 Juftification is a gracious fentence of God, wherebjr forChriftsfakc apprehended by Faith he doth abfolve the believer from fin and death, & accounts him righteous unto life. R(m.'^*22.%^. The righteoufnefle of God by Faith of leftis Chrift in all, and upon all that believe : as they who arc freely juftificd by his grace through the redemption made by

7.1t is the pronouncing of a fentence, as the ufe of the word dedares, which doth not fet forth a phy ficall^or re.^l! change in the holy Scriptures : but that judiciall. or n^orall change which confifts in pronouncing of a fentence and in reputation ProvAJ^i'i* He that juftifies the wicker^. Rnn?.S.^^. Who ftiall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Eleft ?Itis

God that Juftifies. t , r /

8. Therefore T^^»^^ with his followers doth fowly erre, who would have juftification as it were a phyticall motion, by a reall tranfmutation from a ftatc of unrightoufnefle to aftateofrightecufnefTe^fo as that the terme from which is fin the terme to whicb^is inherent righteoufnefle, and the motion is partly remiffion of lin^partly invdion of righteouftes. ^ Q^ 9«lhis



9. This fefitencc was. i- As it were conceived in tkc mind of God by a decree of juftifying.G'<^/;5.8. The Scripture forefecmg that God would jiittifie the ^^«r/7<rJ- by Faith* 2. It was pronounced in Chhit our head 5 now rifing frooi the dead* 2 Cor. 5.19. GodwasinChrift reconciling the world tohitnlclfcnotiraputing their fins to thecn* ?• It is virtually pronounced upon that firft relation which arifcth upon Fiaith begotten, Rom^^.u There is therefope no condemnation to them that are in Chrift Jefus. 4. It is cxprcfly pronounced by the Spirit of God *itneffing unco our fpirits oitr reconciliation with God. Rom^'y.'y The Iwe of God is flied abroad in our hearts by the holy Spirit tbac is given fou^ In this teftimony of the fpirit juftification it felfe doth not fo properly confift, as an aduall perceiving ofthat before granted as it were by a rcfleftcd aft of Faith.

10. It is a gratious (entence^ becauleit is not properly given by the Jufticeof God5but by hisgrace^ Rom.:^^^ Freely by his grace. For by the fami5 grace whereby he called Chrift to the office of Mediatory and did draw theeleftto Union with-Ghrift, he doth account them being already drawn and believing.to be)uft by that Union*

11. It is for Chrifts iak^, a Cor.5.21. Thatv^re mayiip made the righteoufnefle of God inWin » fqr the obedience of Chrift is that rightcouihefTc in refpeft whereof the grace ofGoddothjuftifieus, noothcyviife, then the difbbedience of Adam was that offence in refpeft whereof the juftice of God didcondemneus./tr#5,i8. ,.

II* Therefore the righteo\ifn^fle ojfChriftjisimputed to believers in juftification. "P^rV.j.p. That I maybefoundln him not havi ng mine own righteoufnefle which is ot the Law, but that which is by Faith of Chrift^the righteoufnefle of God through Faith. -. j. m^ ••

2o.JufUfication abfolves from fin and death not immediate ly by taking away the blame, or flaine, oralltheefFedsof fin: but that oblation and guilttoundergoccternall death. S#. 8.i,33,34.Thcreis n© condcmnation,who (hall lay any thing to their charge 'i who (hall condemne ?

Of Aipftior.

I. A Doption is ^bc gracious fcatcacc ef God whereby aA he accepts the faichfqll for Qhrifts fake, unto the

JL jLdignityofSons. M/^ i»i2. As many as receive him^ to them he gave power tp be ma,{^e the Sons crf^God, to thoft that believe in his Namet

2. It is called a gracious (entence of God : becaufe it doth, manifeft the gracious will of God toward men: i lohn 3 j.See what love the Father k^th (k^^.tqus, xh^^ ?iftftpv4<J b^ci* led the Sons of God. . .^e^b iin^-^'' .1 > mI : > -> -

3; This fentence is pronounced with the ifame diverfity of degrees as juftiiication; for it was iirl^ In Gods predefiination* Eph.i.%^ He hath predeiiinated qs^^that Ij^e might adopt us tp be Sons. Afterward it.was in CJi.yft^ ^^^•4*435*God hach fent forth his Son^ that we might receive adoption. After-wa^fd;;t WAS iq b^ievers therafelvcs , The fame Gh^ptier ferfe 6. And becaufeyee areSonnei God hath fent forth the Spirit of his^ Sonne into your hearts^ ^^ying^t/^^^n

4. It is properly convcrfantab^Qt the faithfuy that are c«Ii-kdand^/nftified, M^^d^i^^For by adoption we ape not made jali; which would neceflarily follow, if adoption wtm parr pn^ftifi^^^^^Pfl^t ^4^9^51 fpmewoy^^ .• neither Is It a

5* Yet calling and Juflificadon have the rcfpeft of a foundation to this relation of Adoption: for the right of A« doption is obtained by Fakb>and the righteoufnefle of FaitL

XohnHiz^ , ..;. ; <^.

6iBut although Adoption follow upon Faith: yet it doth not foimmediatly foiiow^but juftification comes betweene:

fer



{at Adoption df its ownc nature doth forereqiiirc ^ and pre-(iippotc that reconciliation which is found in Juftification^

7. Hence all the faithfull doe expeft Heaven as it were by a double title, namely by the title ot redemption which they havebyiuitification, and by the title as it wereofSon-fiiip, which they have by Adoption.

8. Which yctoQght fo to be underftood thatthetitJeof re-redemption is a foiindacion of this right5 and Adoption doth ad a certaine manner of excellency and dignity*

f. Hence ari(eth the firft difference betvveene Divine A-doption and humane : for humane Adoption is ofaperfon thatisaftrangefjWhich hath no right to the inheritance, but by force of Adoption : but the faithful! although by naturall generation they have no right to the inheritance of life, yet by vertiie of regeneration, Faith and juftificationjthcy have k ad judged to them,

lo. Hence alfo the (ccond difference followeth,that humane adoption is only an extrinfecall denomination, and a communication of thofe things which are externall : but Divine adoption is a relation fo really that it is alfo founded in an intrinfecall adion^ and in the communicating of a new kiwarilife*

U.This-Adoption is made for Chrifts fake : bccauft Chrift did not only dcferve it as Redeemer,(7^/.4v5. That he might redcemetbem, to receive the adoption of Sonr. But alfo as being already applied by Faith^he is the bond of this Union jfI<;w«8.i7*29,H€iresof GodjCoheires with Chrift.To be con^ formed to the Image of his Son.

12. For as Chrift in juftificationis applied as a garment to cover our fi«S': fo in Adoption he is applied as a brother and Prince of our falvation. H^^r. 2 • i c* i t,i 2,13. Many Sons. The Prince of falvation. He that fanciificth, and they that arefanft^fied are all of one. He is not aftiamed to call them Brethren. Behold I and the children which God hath given mee.

13. This application and conjunftion is fo neere, that although Chrift is properly the only natural! Son of God, and much more the firft begotten of God : yet by this grace of Adoption, and communion with Chriflj alltbt faichfiill

alfo



alfo arc (aid to be the firft begotten of Godt HebALti^. Ycc arc come to the uaiverfall aflTcmbly and meeting of the firft borne who arc written in Heaven*

14. Whence alio it appeares that believers are in a far different manner the Sons of God then Ad^im was in thchrft Creation : for although ^</^»^ by reafon of tfcatdependancc which hec had of God together with that fimilitude and Image to which he was created , might be called racta-phorically the Son of God; yet he was not the Son of God by this my fticall con junftion and communion with Chrift who is the naturallSon of God»

15. Hence ariftth the third difference bctwcenc humafic adoption and divine, for humane adoption was brotight in upon want ofa natural! Son : but the divine Adoption is not

* from any wantj but out of aboundant goodnefle, whereby a Iflccnefleofa naturallSon, and a my fticall conjunftion with him is communicated to the adopted Sons.

16. That dignity which this Adoption brings with it, doth not onely far exceed that common relation whereby God is faid to be the Father of every Creature : but that alfb which we had before the fall: because that was weake, but this by reafon of the band doth rcmaine for ever, John S.ja. The fcrvant abidech not in the houfe for ever: but the Son abideth for ever.

17. Hence the Name ofGod and ofChrift is named upon the faithfully by a fpeciall right and rcafbn. I yfi'/?^^ 3.1. As Jacob taking the (bns oflofeph into adoption would have them called by his name. Ge^.^S. 5.

18. Hence alfo the faithful! are taken as it were into Gods Family^ andareofhishou(hold% GaL6.ic. That is , that they may be alwayes under the fatherly tuition of God, de- ! pendinguponbimj fornourifliment, education, andpcrpe-tuall confcrvation : as in old time among the Hehrcwes a- , doption oftentimes was no otherwifc teftiiied then by the ' nurtirring and education ^ of their next kindred in blood. I i Jieji. 2, J. I I

< ip.Togcther with the dignity of fons there is joyned alfo I the condition of hcircs, Rom.S.iy. If fons^thenalfoheircs.- ' ^ But this inheritance to which the faithful! are adopted, is

bleffedneiTe .



of Adoption. bleflcdncflc cternall : whence adoption doth fometinieg in Scripture comprehend all that glory which is prepared for the faithful I , and is expefted by them in Heaven, Ron?. 8, 23. Looking for our adoption, the redemption of oijr bodies. ^ r 20. Therefore etcrnallbleflredneflcpertaines to tht iaith-full,and is communicated to themj^HOt of juftice for their de-fcrtf, but from that grsce whereby they are taken into the number of fonsii Gal.^.^9. If yee are Chfifts^then are yee yf-hrahams fee i,and heires by promife.

21. Hence arifcth a ccrtaine fourth difference bctweenc humane adoption and divine :for humane adoption is ordained for that that the Son might fucceed the Father in the inheritance : but divine adoption is not ordained for fuccefiion, but for participation of the inheritance affigned; becaufe both ■ the Father and his firft begotten Son liveth for ever^aad fo ad-mittethno (ucccffion,

12 • A proper adjunft of this adoption is the tcftimony of the (pirit which is given to the faithfaU whereby this dignity is^aJcd together with the inheritance which is to be expeO:-ed from it, and it is called the (pirit of Adoption, Rom.%.i 5.

23. But the Spirit is laid to be communicated to the faithfully not becauft Faith goeth before all operation of tiic Spirit, as (bme unskilfully gather: for the very firft regenera-tion and converfion is plainly attributed to the holy Spirit by Chrift. hhnj.^^yS^Z, Borne of the (pirit: but becaufe believers onely after they have already believed, doe receive this operation of the holy Spirit whereby they are lealed, as withanearneft of their inheritance. Efh.ui^.i^^/^. 30.

24. And hence alfo it doth (ufBciently appeare that aflii-ranee of falvation is not properly juftifying Faith, but a fruit ofthatFaith:becaufe the Apoftlc cxprcfly (aith. After yee believed,ye were fealed. Eph.ui 3.

25. The firft fruit of adoption is that Chriftian liberty. Whereby all believers are as fet at liberty by a roanumiffion as it were from the bondage of the Law, (in and the world. John 8,32.3 6. If the Son ftial fet you fi:ec,fc(hal be free indeed*

J. For as by juftification a believer is properly freed from the guilt oi fin 3 and hath life adjudged to hirUj the title of which life is as ic werejdeterrhincd in adoption; fo by fanfti* iicatioa the fam« believer is freed from the filthineflc and ftaine of iinne and the purity of Gods Image is reitored to him,

6. For here by Sanftification is not underftood thefepa-ration from a common ufe and confecration to fome fpecxall life , in which fence the word is often taken in Scripture, fomctime ietting forth onely the outward, foraetimc alfo that inward and cffc^all feparation j for fo it may be extended to calling or that firft regeneration whereby Faith is communicated as a principle of new life I in which fence rcge* neratiqn and Sanftiflcation is wont to be confounded by moil'; but by it is uad^rftood that change of a man, whereby i believer hath righteoufnefle and inherent holinefle communicated to them. 2 Thejf.2.1^.

17.

G HAPTER XXXI.

Of the (^hnrch myfikalljf conjuiered.

Thus mHch of the affUcation of Redemptiotuconfidcred in itfelfe:

The ffebjcEl to vphichy and the manner by r^hieh this

application ismadf^dothfollow.

iJ I »H E Subjcft is the Church. i5/»/?. 5.2 '^^26^2j.C\\n& I loved the Church^and gave himfclfe for it : that he JL might fan^iHe it being purified by him with the wafhiBg of water through the Word: that he might make it to himfclfe glorious, that is , a Church not having fpoi or wrinkle or any (uch things but that ic might be holy and un-blameablc: whence Election, Redemption,Vocation, Jufti-fication^ Adoption, Sanftificatien^ and Glorification doe in their propriety belong to the fame fcbjeft, that iy^to the fame Angular men 3 which make the Church. I^hnij.^.io^iiii* I pray for them 5 I pray not for the World, but for them whom thou haft given mee^ becaufe they arc thine,' Rom. 2. 29.30^ For whom hee hath fore-knowne, them hee did pre-d:eftinate5&c.

^ z. Y^t the Church hath fo the confideratign of a fubjcft in refpcft of this application, that it is alfo aneffeftofthc fame applicatiba : for it is not firft aftually a Church>and afterward made partaker of Union and communion with Chrift } but becaufe it is united to Chrift,therefore it is the Church of Chrift.

3. And this is the reafbn why we can neither explainc nor underftand the nature of the Church, unleflfe thofe things whichpcrtaine to the application of Chriftj be firft explain^ and perceived.

4. The eleft before they be grafted into Chrift are in them-felves no otherwifc of the Church, then that power which mits owne time (hall certainly come into aft, byrcafonof

Gods



Gods intention and his tranfaaion with Chrift : becaufe that remote power which is common to all men, inrclpeftofthc elcftjis certainly determined in God.

5. Therefore thofe orthodox Divines, which define the Church a company of eleft ones, doc either by elcft ones un-derftand, thofe that are called according to elcftionjor^ they define the Church not only as it doth aftually cxift, but alfo as^it is to be hereafter.

6i That firft thing which doth make aSually a Church is calling : whence alfo it hath taken both its name and definition.

7. For the Church is a company of men that are called. I Cor. i%2 4. With I a3 2.Called both levrcf and Greekss. To the lei^es ^ to the Greekes, and to the Church of God. But be-caufc the end of calling is Faith j and the workc of Faith is ingrafting into Chrift ^ and this Union with Chrift, doth bring with it communion with Chrift, hence it is defined, in the very fameftnce^a company of believers, a company of thoie who are in Chrift; and a company of thofe that have communion with Ghrift^^

8,But as Faith doth Co refpeft Chriftjasthat by Chrift alfo it refpcfts God 5 fo this Church,which dothexift by Faith is both referred toChrift as to the head,and by Chrift untoGod: whence the Church is called the body of Chrift. ^^/.i. 24^ And alfo the Church of God» iC^r.io. 32. TheKingdome of Chrift, Co/ofo i. 13. And the Kingdome of God, t Ronj.i^. 17.

9. It is called a company : becaufe it doth confift properly in a multitude joy ned in fcUowftiip together^ or a community of many, not in Tome certaine one that is called : whence Sph.^.i6. It is called a body fitly joynedandcompafted to-gether^of divers members 3 and by the fame reafbn it is often called in Scripture an Houfe, a Family, a City^ a Kingdome^ a Flock, &c.

10. This company is reftrained to men; becaufe the good Angels^althoughin fbme refpe&they pertaine to the Churchy by reafon of that Union they have with Chriftj and the grace of confervation communicated by hira^yct they arc not ho??ici-' gent all members of the Church redeemed^

S3 11.The



of ihe clutch myftictilty ccnfidtred.

If. The forme or conftuuting caulc ot this Church ir«ft needs be fuch a thing which is found alike in all the called:bat: this can be nothing ci{e then a relation , neither hath any relation that force btlidc^ that that conilfts in achiefeand ifirimate ;?itcttiontoChrift : but there isnoiiich iu man be-fides Filth : Faich therefore is the foiircof the Church.

12 For Faith as it is in every believer, difti ibuiivelyjis the fornne of thofe th^t are called : but as it isconfidciedinail coile&ively, it is the forme of the company ol thofc that arc called,thatis the Church.

i3» For the fame, believing men^ who being in fcvcrall diflributively^confid red arc the called of G A . are aiio tbq Church oi Godjas they ar^ Jc^} ntly or collcftivcly confidcred in a company.

14. Hence all thofe promifes of God which arcmadeco the Church in the Scriptures, and doe con aine in themftlvcs cflcntiall biellings.doe alio pertaine t ? every believer.

15. This relation is fo reere^tl a in refpefk of it^, not only Chrilt is the Churches 5 and the Church Chrilh, Cant.t. VerfeiS. But alfo Chritt is in the Chutchjand the Church in him. John i ^Verfe.^. l Ivhn ^^Verfe 24 So that tht Church is myftically called Chrift. i C^r. 12.12. Andthcfullncflcof Chrift.<?p^* .23,

16. Hence the Church by a metaphor is called the bride, and Chrift the Bride-groome: the Church a Clty,and Chrift theKing^rhc Church an Hou(e,anu Chrift the Houfe-holder; the Church the brancheSj and Chrift the Vme : finally the Chu' ch a body,and C rift the head.

17* But by thefc comparilbns, there is fignificd not onely the Union and Communion which is betweene Chrift and the Church , but alfo the way of order whereby Chrift is the beginning of all dignity, lii:e,powcr5 and pcrfedion, to theChuich.

18. This Church is myftically one, not generally^ but as it were ih^ Species Specialijfima j or Individuum : bccau(e it hath no kind properly io called.

• \g. It is therefore called catholique,not as catholiquc (ignifics a C^^^^ or fomc gcnerall thing ^ but as it fets forth fomething integrally univi^rialL) ( as when we fay the univcr-

far



(all world) bccaufc it con taints the faithfull of all Nations, of al places^and of all times.

20. ThercForc no p^rt of the Church can truly be called catholickjbut as it doth profciTe that Faith which xi the Faith of thccachoiick Church, in which fence the Ancient.^ did not oacly call that pair of the Church which was at Romcy but other Churches alio. As our Church at Fy-Ane^-yj^m^y be rightly called catholic.':, as it doth proiciTe that Faith which belongs to the catholick Church.

31. The Church is dcvided into members according to the degrees of c'omiTiunioa which it hath with Chrift^ in which refpcft ic is called eicher Militant, or Triumphant.

32. Th: Church militant is that which is partaker oncly of communion begun: and Gj doth wraftle as yet with enemies in the field of this World. iCor,i:}.g.i2 We know in parC5 and prophefie in part : for we fee now through a OlaflTc and darkly. 3 Coy.io.^ The weapons of our warfare. Eph.6.i 2,15. Wee wralile , therefore take to you the whole Armour of G O D.

25. The church triumphant is thatwhichisalready pcr-fated. J/)^^4*i5#LIntillweallcemct6aperfcft man^ to the Bacafeife c^the full ftature ofChrift.i C'ora J. Aftercommctb ihat which 18 pcrfeft.

24. The militant Church is both invifible and vifible^ aamely with outward fight or ience.

35. Bucthisdiftinftionisnotadiftribution of the ^enf^s into the Species , as if fo be there were one Church vifible, and another invifible ; nor of the whole into the members, asifonepartof the Church werevifiblc, and another invifible : but a diftinftion of the adjunfts of the fame fubjecfVj becau(e invifibility is an affe£Wonor manner of the Church, in refpcft of the eflentiall, and internall forme: vifibility is an afFedion or manner of the Church in refpeftofthe accidental l,and outward forme.

26. The eflentiall forme is invifible ibecaufc it is both a relation, which doth not come into the fence, and alfo fpi-ricuall, andj ib reoxrved more irom feirccihen in many other leUtionSr

a7*Thc



ay.Theaccidcntiall forme is vifible, becaufe it is nothing clfe then an outward profeflion of inward Faith, which may be eafily perceived by (cncc.

28. This vifible profcffion is that vifible communion of the Saints which they have with Chriftj and among themfelves.

29. The afts of communion with Chrift are thofe vifible afts, by which they prefcnt themfelves to God in Chrift to receive his blcfllngs, and to give the glory of them to him.

30. The ads of communion among themfelves arc all thofc aftsjby which they ftady to doe good each to other; but ef-pecially thofe which direftly make to further their<:ommuni-on with God in Chrift-

3 J. Many afts of this latter kind arc to be cxerciftd alfo toward thofe who as yet are not members of the Church: bccauft by a certaine power they arc to be judged to belong to it.

32, This Churchasitisvifibleinitfclfejisinrefpeftofo-thers and comparatively alfo diftinguiftied into the Church lying hid,and manifeft.

33. That which is manifeft is when the number is greater, and the profeffion more free and more poblicfr,

34.That which is hidden is when the number is leflfe, and profeffion leflc op>;n : which is wont to come to pafle by rca* fon of herefies, perfecations, or prophanc manners abounding abroad.

3 5.1n the (ame refpcft alfo the Church is purer and impur-cr, as the profeflion is more or lefleperfeft.

36.But this profeflion doth not depend upon confefllon only and preaching of the Word, but alfo upon the receiving of it and religious obedience to it.

37. But although the Church be fubjeft to fuch changes, and may leave any part of the World»yet it hath never totally failed, or (hall f aile from the beginning of the gathering it to the end of the World.

38. For Chrift mufl alwaycs have his Kingdome in the mids of his enemies, untillhee (ball make his enemies his footc-ftoole.

39. Yea the Church doth never wholly ceafe to be vifiblcj for althougk fometimc there fcarfe appeare a ChiH^ch any

where



where fo pure, that one may fly unto k in communiou of the fame worftiip in all things : yet the Church doth in fome fort abide vifible in that very impurity of worfhip and profcffion.

Chapter XXX II.

Of the Church Injlituud.

I. / I *HE Church as it lives upon Earth^although it be I not wholy vifible together, yet it is vifible in its JL parfs, both dividedly in the feverall members, and joyntly in companies or Congregations.

2. The former vifibility is by mens perfonall profeflion which doth not make a Church limply vifiblc^butincertaine members 5 or vifible members of the Church, although the Church in ic felfe cr in its integral! ftateisnot vifible in the fime place. Alls 19 i P^///came to £/?^^//^ where he found ceitdine Difciples

3. That vifibility 3 which is in diftinft companies or congregations, doth not only make a vifible Church^but touching the outward forme doth make fo many vifible Churches 0IS there are diftinft congregations. RcvcLi.^. The feven Churches,2 Cor.%.i.ipm The Churches oicMacfdoma^^iU the Churche?#

4. For thofe congregations arc as it werefimilary parts of iht cathoHck Church^and £0 doe partake both of the name and nature of it.

5. Therefore a particular Church in refpefl of that common nature which is found in allparticularChurches, is a Spfcies of the Church in generall, but in retpeft of the catho-lick Church which hath the rclpeft of an ^whole, it is a member compounded of divers (everall members gathered together I and fo in refpeft of thofe members it is alio an whole.

6* Such a congregation or particular Church is a fbciety of believerce joyned together by a fpeciall band among chem<

T fclves,



ftlves , for the conftanc exerd(e of the communion of Saints among themftlvej.

7. It is a (bciety of believers :becau(c that fame thing in profcffion doth make ' a Church vifible, which by Its in-ward and reall nature doth make a myfticall Church, that iSg Faith.

8. Bjt becaufe true Faith hatlr holineffe joyncd with it^ which it doth efFefluallyworkcj Acts 15. 9, And fothepro-felfion of crite faith cannot be disjoyned from the profeflTion of liolineffe, the^-eforc the Church is promifcuouflyand in the fame fenfe called , a fociety of believers 5 and of Saints. Sph.i.i. To the Saints which arc at EfhsfmznA faithful! in ChriftJefiiM Cor.ia* compared with, 2 Cor.1^1. Rem^i.j. ColofA*7.

9. Hence viiible and particular Churches alfb,by reafon of this Faith which they profeflc, are rightly faid to be in Go J the Father 5 and in the Lord Jcfus Chrift. i Thef[. !• i. 2 Thefj.i,

10. It is alfo very probable that there is no fuch particular Church in which the profeffion of the true Faith flourifh-cth,but in the fame alfo there are found fome true believers

11 .But thofe who are onely believers by profeiTion^folong as they remaine in that fociety are members of that Church, as alfo of the catholick Church as touching the outward (late, not touching the inward or eflentiali ftate.l lohn 2.^c|. They went out from us,but they were not of u?»

I at Among believers there are to be accounted as members of the Church the children of thoft believers who arc in the Church: iCor.j.i^ Your children are holy. For they arc partakers of the fame covenant, and the fame profeffion with their parents.

13. Yet infants are not fo perfeS members of the Churchy as that they can cxercifeafts of communion 5 or be admitted to partake of all the priviledgcs thereof^ uoltflc there doe firft appeare an increaft of Faith : but they are not to be excluded from thofe priviledges which pertaine to the beginning of Faith and entrance into the Church.

14. Believers doe not make a particular Church^ajthqagh peradventwe many may meete and live together in the



of the ChrchltfftHyted* |j^l

fimc place, unleflfe they be /oyncd together by a fpcciaU bond among thcmfelves ; for Co fomc one Church fliould ofceh be diffolved into many, and niany alfo (hould be con« founded into one.

15* This bond is a covenant, either exprefle or inipiicite, whereby believers doe particularly bind tnemfelves^ toper-forme all thofc duties 3 both toward God and one toward another, which pcruine to the refpeft and edification of the Church.

16. Hence it is thatinthe oldT^ftamentweedoeforthe moft part fo often read of the renewing of their covenant | as there is related any folcmne reformation of the Church*

i7.Hence none is rightly admitted into the Church,but by coafelfion of Faith and promift of obedience.

24. It is nottherefore in the poorer of man either to take away any of thofe things which Ghri!l hath granted to his Chiirch^or to ad other to thcnvof the like kind : although he may and ought by all lawfull meanes to provide, that thofe things which Chrift hath ordained may be farthcj^ed 3 and confirmed,

25. But Chrift hath fo inftituted the^Church^thatital-V?ayc6 depends upon hirafelfe as upon the head, fo that if it be didinclly Gonfidered without Chrift, it is not a com • pleat body.

26,Hence the Church itfelfemay notproperly make new LawcB to her fclfc of new things to be ordained, butftce ought onely tocare for this^that ftieedoe well find out the will of Chrift,and obfervc his ordinances in order and decent-lyjWith grcateft fruit of edification.

27. But beciufe the ordinances of Chrift have alwayes a bleffingof God joyned with them, therefore here are divers promifes of God o^ade to the Church of the prefencc of Churift.

7. A fpirituall or regall power of govcrnmeot whereby one workech of his owne libmy and will^is not belongii^ to jncn, but to Ghrift alone.

8. Hence a Minifter of the Church is bound to execute hij office by himftlfe, as one that hath not power to appoint any vicar in his place 5 for this (hould norbcanaftionofobedi-cncc,but of command.

9. Therefore one that is a conftanc Minifter of divers Churches which are neceflarily to be provided for by Vicars, is not of Gods Ordaining, but of mans ambition and pre-(umption.

« o. The power k not abfolute^but relative, that is, it doth notconfiftinansbfblutepower to doe any things but in a right 5 whereby one hath power to doe that rightly and law-ftilly which he might not before fo doc^ and therefore it is ToteJlasJHru^z power of rights

I i^Thc right of the Miniftcry depends upon calling,Hr^. y. ^.Neither doth any take this honour to himfclfc^but he that is called of God^as was Aarotf.

13. A calling is an adion whereby an office is comitted to any with authority to Miniikr.

14. Therefore they arc very ridiculous who doe (b ordainc the calling of Minifters, that they girc them not power to pre^h the wordjUnlcfle they have Ibmc new grant.





15 • A EKcefTary adjunft of a calling is ficncfle to the Miuiftery*

18. From th« Miniftery there arifeth a third ftate of the Church : for as by Faith it hath its cflendall ftatc, and by a combination its intcgrall ftatc : fo alfo by the Miniftcry it hath a cercaineorganicall ftate : becaufe it is now made fit to excrcift all thole operations which pertainc to the good of the whole,

ip.Thccoarleand dirc(5lion of thefc operations, isEccle-fiafticall polity.

20> Ihe forme of this polity is altogcthermonarchicall in refpeft of Chrift, the head and King ^ but as touching the vifible and vicarious adminiftration, it is of a mixt nature, partly as it were ariftocraticall ^ and partly as it were dc-mocraticalK

21. Hence in the lawfiill Miniftery of the Churchj Hierarchy holy principality hath no place^but rather Hieroduly^ or holy Service.

22. Therefore one Minifter t$ not fub|efted unto the power of another in his difpenfation, but ail doe imcnediatly depend on Chrift: as tho(e Angells which are inferiors in office to others 3 are ioKnediatly fubjed unto God , not ta other Angels*

25.Hen ce (cich Minifters have alwayes gifts and aftiftance ex^ traordinary,fo that they doe Minifter without error.

16. The right of an extraordinary Minifter isbeftowed properly neither from man,nor by man, but from God alone by Jeftis Chrift and the holy Spirit.G^/. i»i.

2j. Hence the calling to fuch a Miniftery is immediate, 28. Yet every extraordinary callings is not fo immediate that it excludes all Miniftery of men; asappearcs in the calling of Elifeu^y and Matthias ; but it excludes onely that Mi-nittery which is deftitute of an infallible dircftioii;

29 This extraordinary Miniftery was very ncccflary for the Church, becaufe that will of God which pertaines unto living wdl to God, could not be found out by humane in-^liftry and ordinary meaner 5 as all otho! Artsand Sci^ces,

31. The manner of this revelation was (o powerfuU, that it did draw men oftentimes into an cxtafic or trance^where-by they were fo caught above theitifelves, that they perceived nothing be(ide that that was propounded, neither all that thing it felfe according to all its circumftances ^ 2 Cor. 13. 3- 4- .

32. Yet it is fo certaine 5 that the divine truth ofit is often confirmed, and ina certaine (peciall manner fealed to them to whom it is r^evealed : (6 as it need not another confirma-liom GaL\.i'j.2^2.6. Neither did I rcturne to thofe who were Apoftles before me. . They who were in eftimation added nothing to mee : Although fometimes alfo for the more abundant confirmation miracles are added.

36. The Miniftcry of confcrving,and reftoring a Chtircb, although it be extraordinary, and is alwaycs confirmed by miracles 3 yet it doth not alwayes or neceflarily require a teftimony of miracles: as appeares in many in the old Tefta-ment,and in ^e?/?;^ the Baptift.

petuallufc, and fruit of ih'^s Miniftery in the Church^cvcn

when foch Minifters were taken away.

2. For they oncly could commit the rule of Faith and manners to writing, who by reafon of the immediate and in-fallibie direftlon which they had from God, were in that bu-fineflc free from all error.

3. They received a command of writing from God, partly cxternallyjboth generally when they were commanded to teach, and fpecially fomctimes, when they were commanded to write, Z)wr.3* 19. RevtU !• ip. Write ycc the SongjWrite thofc things which thou haftfecnc, and partly hy the inward inftinaofthefpirit.2'?^.i,2?. For prophecy came not in old time by the will ofman, butlholymcn f^keasthey were moved by the holy Spirit. 2Tini.2.\6. ^]1 Scripture is infpired by God.

4.Thcy wrote alfo by the in^iration and guidance of the holy Sphk/o that themen themfclves were as it were inftru-4Rents of trbs fpirit. In the place before, ^erem. m^^ Behold I put my words inthy raouth, ABs 2S.25, Well indeed (pake iChc holy Spiritty Efaias the Prophet.

5» But Divine infpiration was prefcnt with tfaofe writers wkh iome variety, for ibme things to be written were before ^together unknov/ne to the writer, as doth iiifficlcntly appcare in the Hiftory of the Creation paft, and in fore-tellings of things to come : but fome things were before knownc 'Unto the wjiter , as appeares in the Hiftory of Ghrift, written by the Apoftles; and fome of theft they knew by a naturall knowledge, and fome by a fupernaturaJl; In

6* In all tho/e things which were made known by ftper-nitufallinfpiution, (whether they were matters of right, DC £ji£i ) he did infpirc not onely the things themfelvcs,^ bui did^ di(flatc and fuggcft all the words in which they fhould be written : which notwithftanding was done with ihafcfw€etc attempering, that every writer, might uft thdfc maners of (peaking which did mod agree to his perfoR and condition.

> HeOise the Scripture is often attributed to the holy Sfuk as to the author^ making no mention of the Scribes* ihhc7»erio.i'^. Whereof the Holy Ghoft alfo is a witneflc to IH.

S. Hence alio 5 although in the infcriptions of the holy Bookes it is for the nioft part declared by whofe labour they were written, yetthere is (bmetimcs deepe filence of this matter, and that without any detriment of fuchbookeSjOrlef-fening their authority.

9. Neither yet doth itfuffice to make a part of holy writ Jf abooke be written by (bmcextraordinary (ervaniof Godj and uponcertainediredion of thc(pirit:unlcfleic be al(b pub-lickly given to the Church by divine authority, and fenftifed ^to be a Canon or rule of tlie fame. ' 10. The thing it felfe which they Committed tb wti-ting, as touching the (iimme and chiefe end of the matter, is nothing elfe, then chat revealed will of God^which is the rule of Faith and mancrs.

IX* Hence all thofe-things which in the flrltdifputation were fpoken of the doftrine of life revealed from God, doc properly agree to th6 holy Scripture. For the Scripture is nothing clfc then that doftrinc 5 with the manner of writing joyncd te it 5 which nuanncr was not to be handled thereout inthispkce. ^ ' f v ''

meaning, that is, as ic was the doftrine revealed from God, it was before the Church : but in refpeft of the manner in which it is properly called Scripture , it is after the fitft Church. / ^ :

13. It if called the holy Scripture , and by»«/l§oj^w the Scriptur&j and the writers them(elves are called holy, partly in rcfpeft of the fubjcd, and objeft matter, wh?ch is (b called, the true and faving will of G o d , and partly in re-(peft of that dircftion whereby it was committed to writing, Romans 1.2. Ephc.^^'y. 2Tetcr 1.21, & 2.128c 3.21 Rev.1i.20.

14.But although divers parts of the Scripture were written,

upon fome fpeciall occafion, and were direftcd to Ibme cer-

tainemcn, or aflTemblics: yet in Gods intention, they doe

as well pertaine to the inftruAing of all the faithful thorough

all ages, as if they had beene fpecially direSed to them:

whence, H^^. 12. The exhortation of Solomon , which is

ufed in the Proverbs^i^ faid to be fpokcn to the HebreweSyVtho

The holy Scriptures can make ^ thee wife unto falvation, that the man of God might be per- ^ fe&,,perfe5ttyfurnifhed to every good worke*

16. Hence the Scripture is not a partiall,but a perfeft rule oCFaitb , and manners : neither is here any thing that is conftantly and every where neceflary to be obferved in the Church of God , which depends either upon any tradition, or upon any authority whatfoever aad is not contained in the Scriptures.

17 Yet all things were not together and at once committed to v^rlting, becaufethc flate of the Church and the wiidomeofGoddid 1 tharwift require : but fronl the firft writing thofe rhing!? were fucceffively committed to writing* which werenece0ary in thofcages.

19. As touching the manner of deli very the Stripture doth not explaine the will of God by univcrfall;^ and fcicntifical! rules, but by narrations, examples^ precepts, exhortations, admonitionF,and promiics : bccaufc that manner doth make moft for the common u(e of all kinde of men, and alfo moll toafFeftthewill, and ftirre up gcdiy motions, which is the chiefe fcope of Divinity.

20. Alfo the will of God is revealed in that manner in the Scriptures, that although, the things themftlves are for the moft part hard to be conceived, ^et the manner of delivering and explaining thcm^efpecially in thofe things which are nc« ceflary^iscleereand perfpicDous.

21. Hence the Scriptures need not efpccially in necefla-ries 3 any fuch explication whereby light may be brought to it from Something el(e : but they give light to themlelves, which is diligently to be drawne out^y men^ and to be communicated to otliers according to their calling.

27. H^ncc aUo there is onely one fence of one pi ace of Scripture : becaufe otherwife the fence of the Scripture ftiould be not onely not clcere and certaine,but none at all: for that which doth not fignifie one thing, fignlfieth certainly nothing.

23.For the determining of controverfics in Divinityjtherc is no vifible power as it were kingly or prctorian, appointed in the Church : but there is laid a duty on men to enquire ; there is bellowed a gift of difccrning, both publicfcly and privatly : and there is commanded a defire to farther the knowledge and pra^ife of the known truth,according to their callifag^unto which alfo is joyned a promife of direftion, and blcffing from God.

24. But becaufe the Scriptures were given for the u(e and edification of tb^ Church, therefore they were written in thofe tongues, which were moft commonly vulgar in the Church at that time when they were written.

4. Thesiefore alfo they depend upon extraordinary Mi^ niftcrg, and are as it were thieir fucccflbrs: for although in refpeft of manner and degree extraordinary Mintfters have no fucceflbrs; yet in refpcft of the eflence of adminiftration, ordinary Minifters performe the fame office toward thcChurch as extraordinary did of old, ^

G HAPTER XXXVII.

OfEcclefiaJUcall "Difcifline.

An adjunSl of the PVord and Sacraments is Difcipline :

which in rejpelt ofthefumme efthe matter hath b^ene

alwayes one^and fo may fit/jt be handled in

this one place.

I. y X^'7 ^^^^*P'^"^ ^^ ^ perfonall application of the I 'I Will of God by cenlurcs, cither for the prcven-JL-. Xcmg, or taking away of (candals out of the Church

of God.

2. For in the preaching of the Word, the Will of God is propounded and really applied to beget and iacreafe Faith and obedience. In the administration of the Sacraments, the Will of God is al(b perfonally applied by the (calcs, to con-firme Faith and obedience. In the exercife of Difcipline, the Will of God is perfonally alfo applied in the cenfures for the removing of thofe vices, which are contrary to Faith and Obedienc.

3. Hence it is that Difcipline is wont to be joyned with the Word and Sacraments by the beft Divines^ in the notes



of the EcckJ?aJiicall DifcipUne-oftheChurch, for though ic be not a notcfimply cflciniall and rcciprocall ( as neither the other two ) yet ic ought neceiTarily to be prelcnt to the complete cftateot a Church. 4. This Difciplinc is ordained and prefcribed by Chiit him(clfe. Mat..i6^i9. & 18.15,16^17. And fo is pliitdy of Divine right: neither may it be taken away 5 diraini(hed, or changed by men at their plcafurc.

5 Nay the (ins againft Chrifts, the aothorj and ordainer^ whofoevcr doth not fo much as in him is to cftablifii and promote this Difcipline in the Churches oi God.

6. The pcrfons about whom it ought to be exercised arc the members of vifible inftitutcd Churches , without any exception. Mat.i^.i^^ 1 (^or.^.n. And not others : There Ferf. 12. For it pertaines to them,and only them that have right to partake of the Sacrament.

7» Unto thofe^perfons it applies the Will of God, that is, thole meanes of fpirituall reformation^ fuch asChrift onclyhath given to his Churches. 2 C^r.io. 4, Therefore puniftimcnts and vexations to be endured by the body or purfe, have no place at all in Ecclefiafticall Dilcipline.

8. Itrc(pefts fins and fcandalls in thofe perfons:for it is an wholfclbme hcalifig plaifter of thofe wounds and difeafes to which theiheepeof Chrift are fubje(5^. iCor.^.'y.

9* It forbids and takes away thofe offences: becaufeit doth cffeftually and pcrfonally apply the Will of Chnllj the im« pugrdng and abolifting of them. ^ IC But becrule it doth lo effieftually urge obedience K- toward Chrill , therefore not without fingular reafon a great part of the Kingdome of Chrift as hee doth viiibly governe the Church is placed by the beft Divines in this Difcipline?.

i|. And this isthctru^ rcafbn why the Difcipline of Chrift is folidly conftitutcd and cx^rcifed together with doftrine in fo few Churches , becaufe moft even ofthofc who would feeme to know Chrift, and to hope in him doe refufe to receive the whole Kmgdomc of Chrift^ and to yceld thcmielves wholly to him..

12. But as it is a part of the Kingdome of Chrift, (b alfo it is by the fame reafon a pare of the Gofpeli: for it is an holy

Y 3 manner



manner of protnoting the GpfpcU ordained in theGofpell: They therefore who rejeft difciplinedoc neither receive the whole Kingdome of Ghriftjnor the whole Gofpcli*

13. But bccaufe both every part of the Kingdome of Chi ift is necefTaty in its meafute, and that chiefly which doth re-preflefin, effc(9:i3ally , therefore men doe not (afcly enough content themfelves, in Churches wanting Difciplinc, unlcffe that publick defeft be m^de up by a private ckxc^ and watching one over another.

14« The parts of this Discipline are brotherly corrcftion, and excommunication.

15. For it doth not either only or chiefly confift in the thunderclaps of Excommunications and JiiiaihffMs , but chiefly in Chriftiancorreftior. 'i '^

16. Neither is the proper end of rcproofe that there might be then an entance made to Excommunication ( although by accident that fometimes doe folIow)but that the nectfficy ofExcommunicatingif it canbe , might be prevented, and

Of the adfnwiftratinn of the Qovcfia'ot fr$m Qhrifi exhibited to the eni of the fVor/d*

1. r m ^He manner of adminiftration now Chrift is cxhib-I ted is double^ one uncill the end of the worlds and JL the other in the end it felfc. 2.From Chrift to the end of the world, there is an adminiftration of one raanner^and that altogether new : whence al(b it is called the New Teftament*

5Jt is ofone manner without end or alteration, becaufeit Is pcrfe^ijO thatthcre is not another to be expefted^ta which it fhould give place as to the more pcrfcft.

4. It is the New Teftament, in refpeft of that which was^ from the rime ol-Af^/^j 3 and in refpedrofthepromifcmadc to the Fithers : not in refpcft oi the cflence^but in refpeft of thcmaf nerjbecaufe in them in rcfpeft ofthcmanncrof ad-miniftring , there was lomerepclcntation of the Covenant of workes, from which this Teftanient doth eflentially differ; and {o feeing there didn^ t appeare an integral] difference, of the New Covenant from the Old, but in that adminiftration which is moft properly called the New Covenant

) and Teftament.

5. But it differs from the former adminiftrationjifl quality and quantity.

p Freedome doth confift in this. Fitft, that the govcrn-nientofthcLaw, or mixing of the covenant of workes^which did hold the ancient people in a ccrtaine bondage, is now taken away : wh-ence alfo the fpirit of adoption, although it was neverwholydenycd to the faithful!, yet molt properly it is faid to be communicated under this N^w Tcfta-ment, in which the moft perfeft ftate of believers dorfi moft cleerly appears, Gal.^.'^.

Secondly^ it con{iftsinthis,thatthcyok^ of the cereraoniall Law, as it was an hand-writing againft finncrSj as it did forbid the u(e of things in their nature indifferent 3 as it did command many burdenfome obfervation^ of them, and as it did vaile the truth it fclfc with manifold and carnall ceremonies, h now wholy taken away y CoU 2. 14. 17, Which arc a fhadow of things to comejbut the body isofChrift.

lo.They therefore offend againft that liberty which Chrifl hath obtained for us ^ who obtrude upon the Chrifliaa Churches either lerpiih ceremonies g or other of the like nature with them^religious, and myfticall. For divine ceremonies are not taken away, that humane (hould fuccced in their roomc ; neither is it likely ^ that Chrift would leave fuch my fteries to the will of men, after his comming,when he per-^ ^ mitted no (uch thing to his people ofold, especially feeing he might (b eafily in this kind provide for us 9 if he had judged any religious and myfticall ceremonies nece£fary or profitable for his, befidcs thofc very few which he did by name \ prcfcribe.or at Icaft (hew in certaine Tables^to whom he did grant fuch an auchority^which he no where did. GaL^.u Stand faft therefore in the liberty wherewith Chrift hath made you freehand going back againe be not entangled with a yoke of bondage,

11 .In quantity this adminlflration differs from the focmerj

fedth intenfively and cxtenfively. . r

12. Intenfively, firftj inthattfee application by the fpirft



is more effeftuall ^ aid the gifts of thefpirir are more perfeft> then ordinanlj they were under the Old Tcftament, whence the old adminiftration is comparatively called the Letrcr^and thencwtherpiri..2 C^r.3.6. Secondly^in that it begcttctha more fpirituall life. 2 (^or 3.18.

13. Extenfively, firllin refpeft of place, becaufeitisnot concraft^d to tome one people, as before, but is diffiifcd through the whole world. Secondly, in refpcAof time, in that ic hath no termc of duration before the confum-mation of the whole my fticall Church. 2 Coriyithiayts ^.11. £/?6.4.i3Thac which remainethjUntill we all meet unto a per-feft man, unto the meadire of the full ftaturc of Chrift.

14. But becaufe this new adminiftration is fo perfeft, therefore it ism elite al(b , that the communion of Saints in the Church under the New Teftament bee ordained raoft per ft ft.

15. Therefore in every Church of the New Teftament the whole (blemne and ordinary worfhip of God and all his holy ordinances may and ought to be obfervedjfo that all the members ofthat Church may ordinarily exercife comnauni-on together in them.

16. For it is not now as it was ordained of God in the Church of the /<?k?^/ that fomemorcYoIemne parts of Divine worftiip may beexerciled in one place^&other in other places, but one particular Church is ordaincd,in which al holy office* are to be performed.

) i7.Hence all Chriftian Chiurches, have altogether one and tlie fame rightjthat one doth no more depend upon another, then another upon it.

18. Hence alfo it is moft convenient that one* particular Church doe not confift of more members thea may 4neete together into one place to heare the Word of God, celebrate the Sacraments, offer prayers, and exercife Difci-plinc, and performc other duties of Divine polity, as one body..

19. For it is an Aberration not void of all confufion^tkat in fome greater Cities , although there be more believers then that can exercife that Communion together, yet they ircnotdiftributcd into divers Churches, but doc make one



fo to abound , that the edification ot every one cannot be rightly taken care for and furthered.

20. I hereforc the Church inftituted fi^ce Chrift exhibited^ n not one catholickChurch,fo as all the faithf jll throughout the worl ) fhould be joy ncd together in one and the fame outward band among themfelves, and (bould depend upon one andchcfameA^iriblepartoF, or company of paltorS; but there are fo many Churches as there are companies 5 or particular CctigiegationSjof thofe that profefic the Faith, who are )oy-ned together by a fpcciall band tor the conftant excrcifeof the communion of Saints*

21. For although the myfticail Church,^? it is in its members-, is no other way diriributei then inco the adjuncfls, and fu^tfis, in which refpeA Mt call ihe Church of TSelgia^ of Brit any ^ of France ^ ^s we cdli th«'Sea iCCorH^ngto the ftioreswhich it Waflicthto, thi Bv)^, Lk,Eri :fh , hrtixh Sea, altht ugh it be one and the lawe Sea : yet the inUi?uted ChuicheSj arcdivcismolt Tpccial!

22. Neither is this Church that i» inftituted by God pro-pcrly nationall^provinciall.or Dioeccfan» which rormes were^ brought in by menfrom thepateincot civill government^eli pecially the Romane: but it is Parochially or ot one corgrc-gation, the members whereot are combined among them-(clve5,?nd doe ordinarily meete into one place to the pubiick. excrcilc of religion. ^

2 3. For fuch a company, and not larger, is properly fignK fied by the word l-^hnrla ^burch^ neither hath ic a larger fig-nification in the New Tcftament when it is referred to any vifible and dcfigned company, neither alfo among prophanc authors who are the more ancient.

24,Hence divers fixed Congrcgation8,of the fame Countrey and Province arc alwayes called Churches in the pluraii

26.Neither is there any thing read in all the Newleftament of the inftifution ofany largerChurch upon which Icflcr congregations fliould depend.ncither is there any worfliip or holy ordinance prcfcribcd which is not to be obftrved in every Congregation, neither is there any ordinary Miniftermadcj who is not given to fome one fuch company.

27. Yet particular Churches, as their Communion doth require, the light of nature and equity of rules and examples of Scripture doe teach, may and oftentimes alfo ought to enter into a mutuall confederacy and fcllowfliip among themfelres in Claflcs ^ and Synods, that they may ufe their common confcnt and mutuall belpe as much as fitly may be, in thoft things efpecially, which are of greater moment; but that coBibination doth neither conftitute anew forme of a Church, neither ought it to take away, or diminifti any way, that liberty and power which Chrift hath left to his Churches, for thedircfting and farthering whereof it onely fervet*

a8. The ordinary Minifters doe follow the forme of the Church inftitutedjand arc not OccumcnicallsNationall, Provincial!, or DioeceCm Bifhops, bat Elders of one Congregation, who in the (ame (ence are alfo called Biihops in th6 Scriptures.

29. Thofi tranfcendent members of the Hierarchy were meerly humane CrcaturiBS brought into the Church without any Divine precept or example : They cannot fulfill the office of a Paftor in fo many Congregations. They rob the Churches of their liberty, whilft they exercife as it were, a regall, or rather tyrannicall dominion over the Churches ihraifelves, and' their Psiftors, they have brought in with them the Roman Antichrift himfeife,as the head, and Chan-

In refpeft of Gods Inftitution, there liethgreateftne*-ccfBty upon the faithfoll toufe thcfe Sacraments j tfiligently, and religioufly | yet they are not fo abfolutely neceflary to ' falvation, that the abfence, or mecre privation of them dothr bring a privation of this inftitution : neither ought they in that refpeft, to be celebrated either of thofe that are not law-full Miniftersjor out of a Church aflfcmbly.

$• Baptifme is the Sacrament of Initiation or Regeneration.

6. For although it doth feale tlie whole covenaat of grace together to the faithfoll , yet by a (peciall approbation it doth reprefentj and confirme our very ingrafting into Chrift. *<?w.6,3.We are baptifed inro Chrift Jefus,and Verfe 5.

Faithjthcrc doth immediatly follow a relation of our Juftifi. cation and Adoption : therefore Bapiifnie as the Sacrament of the ingrafting it felfe, is unto remiflion of fins. M^rci. 3, And it is alfo a reprelentation of ado|)tion, whilft that by it wee are confecrated to the Fathcr,Sonnc, and holy Spirit, and their names arc called upon the baptifed.

8. Bccaufc alio holincfle is alwayes derived from Chrift into whom we are ingrafted, unto all thefaithfull, thercforfc BaptiCne alfo is the feale of our fanaification*TiV.3.5 Jlchath favcd us by the laver of regeneration, and the renuing of the holy Spirit.X^w.6*4,5.6.

That we might be madeheircs, according to the hope of eternalllifco. ^^iwx^/ 6.8g If we be dead with Chrift , wee believe that wee Qiall alfo live together with him*

10. But bccauft tho(c benefits arc (caled according to the meaiure of initiation in Baptifmc 5 hence^ Firftj Baptifmeis but once to be adminiftred, becaulc there is but one begin* . ning of fpirituall life by regeneration, as there is but one beginning of naturall life by generation.

15. Faith and repentance doe no more make the covenant of God now then in the time oi Ahrdham ( who was the Father of the faithful!) therefore the want of thofe afts ought no more to hinder bapti(me from Infants now, then it aid forbid circumcifion then*

I4« The figne in this Sacrament is water, not fimply,but as it purgetb the uncleane, cither by dipping or (prink<^ ling.

15; But therefore water was chofen, bccauft there is nothing in uft that doth more£tly reprelcnt that (piritual wafti-ing, which is performed by the blood or death of Ghrift, neither is the (pr inkling or application of the blood of Chrift, fo fitly exprcfled by airy thrng, feeing that now fiocc the death of Chriftjthcrc ought to be no iife of naturall blood in holy thipgs*:

i5*The fupper of the Lord is the Sacrament of the nourift» ^ in^ and growth of the faithfuU in Chrift» : i7« Hence it ought oftentimes to i>e adminiAred to the fiimeperfonf^

18. Hence alfo the fupper is onely to be adminiftred to / thofe 3 who are vjfibly capable of nouriOimenc and growth

in the Ghurch : and (b not to Infants^ butoncly to thofe of age.

19. But becaufe moft full and perfeft nounOiment h iealed in Chrift,therefore here is uied not fome one and fimple figne (/nouri(hing,but of a double kind ^ as the nouri^meet oi the body doth require,uamely 5read and Wine.

2i» But bread and wine are therefore ufcdjbccaafc except the eating of flcfh ( which hath noplace in holy things now the facrifice of Chrift is finiflied ) and the drinking of blood, from which not only religion^but mans nature abhors: there is nothing doth more conveniently expreffethat ncercft union which by degrees wee enjoy with Chrift, which is founded in ths facrificing of his body and (h^dding of his blood.

2 ZsTo faigne any tranfubftantiation, or confabftantiation in this Sacrament more, then in baptifme, is a cerraioe blind and ftupid fiipcrftition.

23. For it is not required to fpiricuall nourifliment in this Sacrament, that the bread and wine be changed into the body and blood of Chrift, nor that Chrift be corporally present with them, but only that they be changed relatively in rcfycBt of application and ufe ^ and that Chrift b^ ^itually preient vf ith them who receive in Faitht

24. This tranfubftantiation» and confubftantiation is a^ gainft t he nature of a Sacrament in generally againft the ana« logy^our other Sacrament, orbaptifme, againft the moft ufiiall phrafes in the Old Teftamenc againft the humane nature ot Chrift againft his ftate of Glorification^and againftlthc revealed will of God> which (aith that Chrift fhall remaine in Heaven untill the day of judgement.

Moft of our interpreters would have a trope in the wordSjthat h^z metaphor or a metonymy.

27. The Lutherans contend that here is no trope to be found, but only an unudxall predicadon*

2 8. There are not a fcw^ and tho(c new Interpretcrg ^ who deny ^ that there is either any proper trope , or unufuall predication, but they; noake it an improper and myfticall predication.

29. But no fufficient rcafon is brought why we may deny that there is a trope in the words : which may be thus dc-monftrated. If it be an improper or unufuall predication ;is they would have it, this unufuall or impropcr'way: ought to be (hewed in fomcword: which if it be done, tlien of neceffity it is that that word be fomc way tranflated f?dm his natural! fignification and ufe: if that be fb, the word takes the nature and definition of a trope.

I i.Refurrcftion is of that which fell: but becauic ma« fell • from life, by the (cparatiun of the foule from the body,ther-fore that he may rile againe, it is nereflT^ry that the fame foule be agame reunited to the fame body,that by the rcftorcd uni n of both^thefamemanmay exift;

ij.Thatfuch a Rcfurreftion is polTible to God kappcareS: becaufe (lich a reparation of man doth not exceed that* power whicn was manife(tcd in his firft Creation. T/7/7,3.2 !•. Accordiag to that efFcftuall power whereby he is able to iub-due all things to him(elfe.

14. But that this Refurrcftion (hall aftually be^it can* not bee certainly demonftrated by any natucall reafbn, i^either^ A priori^ nor Afofierivri^ but it is properly of • Faith*

15 Neither the nature of the loule, nor of the body,can be the caufc of Ele(urreftion : forthe forming againe and railing Ap ot the body, out of the du(t, is againft the wonted courfe ofnattirc, which when it is perfeftlydeftroyed,i8 not wont tQ be repaired by nature : and the infeparable union of the foule wi h the body by which man is made immortalljis above th^i ilren^th of nature.

I • SBSS^^Blervance is that whereby the Will of God is performed with (iibjtr&ion co his glory. 2. It refpefts the Will oi God as a pattcrnCj and a rule, asappeares by the thoi^e words of Cbrift, wherein al(b he de« fcribes our obedience j let thy Will be done as in Heaven, fo alfo in Earth; and did alfo ex* plainc his own obedience. Mat.26^^ f. Not as I will, but as

Deut.29. 29. Things that ai'c revealed , arc revealed, that wee may doc then].

4. It rclpcfts that will with fubjeftlon.fi^w. 8,7. Bccaufc it applies our will to fulfill the Will of Godjas it commands us any thing according to his authority. Rom.S.y. Icisaoc fubjcft to the Law of God.

5. Hence it is called obedience: bccaufc it makes the will ready to commit the command oJ" God to exccutionj being heard, and in (brae meafure perceived.

6. Hence al(b it hath in it felfc (bmc refpeft of Service toward God 5 whence it comes to paffc^that to obey Godjtnd to (ervehim^ found one and the fame thing. Luc.uj^.

nor untruitfiill in the knowledge of our Lord Jefus Chrift.

2.This diftribution is of the whole into members; for theie two are in their own nature joyncd together, and doe make one and the fame obedience,

) 3. Hence both vertues and their anions are fei forth by the lame namey afid are explained alfo by the fame defini* tion, bccaufc they are altogether of the i^me nature : even a3 arguments of Logicke^ are of the (ame name and na-mrc^ whechcr they be confidercd alone and by themfelves, or >in Axioms, and Sy Uogifmes.

^. Vertue is an habit whereby the will is inclined to doe well.

5» It is called an habtt^ notasitisdiftingni(bed fromdif^ pofition,and fignifieth a confirmed and perfeft conftitution of mind : for fuch a degree of vertue isfcarft granted to men^ while they live heere : but generally, as it containes both a; .pcrfe£t and alfio imperfed degree of Vertue 9 and ftat« oi fjliemindf



6. But it is called an habit, not oncly bccaufc it is had» but alfo bccaufe it makcth the fiibjcft which ic is in to have it fclfe in a ccrtaine manner, that is, ic determineithefe-culty to gojd 5 which ochcrwilc is not determined» in which fence this word is found, Hthewes^.i^Mhobyte^^ fon of habit, have their fences excrcifed to difcerne good and evil!.

7. Ic is in the will. Firft, becjufe the will is the proper fubjcct of Theology as it is the proper principle of life, and of moral! and fpirituall a(^ion?. 2 Bccaulc the will is that faculty which is properly carried unto good that ishoncft, Rom. 7.19.21. 3. Becaulc vertuc is an habit that is "rpocu^riKU orcleftivej the proper, and immediate operation whereof is voluntary elcftion* 4. Becaufe the will doth commend the other faculties ^ and fo Vcrtue doth moil agree to it^that all maybe direftcd aright. 5* Becaufc the will is neither by it felfe, norbyreafon luffi iently determined to good j^dions, and fo it hath need of its owne andintcrnalldifpoli^jonto worke aright. 6. 5^aufc the bthcr faciiltife rtiayb^ compelled,and by confequciice one m^y wl^thet* he' wifror no lofe vertuCj if ic(h)uld have tht proper and fixed feat, in them. 7. Bccaiifc that praifc is moft properly due to the afti-ons of the will, and to the operations of the other facaities, fo far forth as they flow from. anc{ depend upon the will 5 but that it is proper to vertue to be praife-wotchy^ not cnely tht Philofophers teach, but alib^ the ApoMe, ^^htlipfiaiif 4^8,1 If there be any vcrtue, if any pray {c.8i ^ccaoft neither the underftanding can be the fubjcft of vertue, becaufc intclleftu-. all habits, although they bee moft perfcft ^ yet they do€ not makca man goad, nor any fenfttivc appetite, bccaufe true vertuc is found in Angels, and the foules being feparated frorn^ bodies, which are void of this appetite : yet there are often in the fenfitivc faculties feme difpofitions , which caufe th^t the will commanding aii^ht is more eafily obeybd, and in that refpcft they have a certaine refcmblancc of Vertuc.

: S.Vc tu- is fai ? toincUne toGod.Firft,thatit may bcdiftin-guiOied from a vLtious habit whereby men are inclined to cvilL Re.y.i 7.2o.»3.l. That it may bediftinguiflied alfo from thofi



pcrfcftions of the mind^which indeed doc bring Iigh(,whcre-by t he will may diicft it fclt'c as well doing, buc not incUnc it to due right.

9.Hence,Firft5truc and folid vcrtucs,doc alwayesmake him good in whom they are : not that the very difpofitions that doc inhere in us, arc the grace making us firft accepted with God, as the Schoolemcn fpeake, for that pertaines to Faith; but becaute they are reciprocated with a good man,and good-neflc is derived from them into our aftions.

10. Hence alfo none can ufc vertue amiflc, as being the principle of aftion ; when notwithftanding men may^and are wont toabufe any habit of the mind.

11. Therefore thofe vertues which are wont to be called in-tclleftualljihave not an exaft refpeft of vertue.

12. Moreover vertue IS fa id to incline sotonely to good* but al(c> to well doing : beciiule themannei of action doth; chiefly flow from vertue.

13. But as the rule ofwcll-dolng^lb alfo the rule of vertue . isthe revealed will of God, whichonly hath the force of acertainc irijic in thofe things .which pertainc totbe^ii^cfti-onoflife. ruh^ . ":j::nr' ?>. ■ ih

15 That which is faid to be right reafoci, if abfolute refti-tude be looked after^ it is notclfc-where to be fought forthen where it isj that is, in the Scriptures : neithcrdoth it differ from the will of God revealed for the direiSion of our life, Pfal.ii 9^66. Teach me the excellency of reafon and knowledge : for I believe thy precepts. But if thofe imperfcft no* tions concerning that which is boncft, anddifhonefl be underftood, which kic found in the mind ofmanafter^he fal!; feeing; they are imperfca and very obfcure^they cannot exaaiy informe vertue ; neither indeed doc they differ any thingfrom the written Law of God^buc in imperfcaioa and obfcurity only.

Cc 3 i(5,There.



efTertue* 16. Therefore there can be no other difciplinc of vertuc then Divinity ,^ which delivers the whole Will of God revealed, for the direftitjg of our reafon will5and life.

17* They-^hat thirike ^hcrwifcj doe bring no rcafous, uAibh may ii>a?c an underftanding and found man. They (ay the end of Divinity is the good of grace : but the end of Et^ickj is a moral! or civ ill good. A^if no n»orall or civill good were.in any refpft^ agood of grace and ffirituall. As if the proper good, bleffcdnefic, or end of mm, were manifold^ orasifthatftiouldbc avertneof a man,^ which doth not lead a man to his end , and chiefe good. They (ay that Divinity is excrcifed about the inward afFciftions of men ; but Ethicks about the outward manners. As if either Etbicks ( which they define a prudence to goveme the-will and appetite) did not refpeft the inward affedion : or that Divinity did not teach as well outward , as inward obedience.

They would have it that Ethickes arc concluded in the bounds of this life, but that Divinity extends to a future. A^ if a blefled life werenot ^mt\ 6v that of one and the (ame IHe^ there were one rule, as it is pre(cnt, and another as it ii Co come. They (ay thefiibjeftof-E^^^Vi^^i isaman, approved,^ good aiid honeiS: ^' but the(nbjedV of Divinity is a godly anJ religious man ^ when notwithftanding the Apoftlfdoth expr^fly teach that Divinity inftru£ls as to live not only pipufly and religioufly, but al(o temperatly 9 and /nftlj^ 1 that is, approvedly and honeftly, Tit.i. 12. Ad to the(e,' th^ themoft eager defenders of the contrary opinion, doe acknowledge and contend, that morall vcrtues are the image c^<)od in nrtan^ndfo a degree of Theological! veftuc 5 and that morall virtue compared to (piritiaajf is as warmth to ) heat^and the morning light to the noone light.

Joy, Peace, Long-fcfFering, KindncflTcj Goodncffc, Faith, Mcckneflc, Temperance, together with the addition which is found in theconimontranflation : and they are compared to vertue?, as is aforefaid of gift«; for neither are they only the fruits of the fpiritjwhich are there exprefled upon the prefent occafi-on, and arc explained in that place with the names of the vertues themfelves : becaufe vcrtucs are fiuits/uch as arc required and cxpeAed by the husband-man 3 and doe agree to the nature of the feed which he did fow, and alfo bring profit and (wectneflc 5 with them, when they are perceived: all which doeagrce to virtues, and their aftions in a certainc manner in refpcft of God j but the profit chiefly in rcfpeft of us: whence alfb ic is that holineffc with all vertues is not only called a fruit of the holy Spirit, but alfo our fruit, Rom.6.22 • But this profit together with the fweetneflc is (hewed in that place to the GaUtians^in as muchas joy^and peace are reckoned tip^as fruirs of the fruits.

23« They alfo ufe the fame judgement, who thinke they have found eight beatitudes in the Sermon of Chrift. LMat. 5. For there isbutone bea itude, but feeing, it hath divers fignes, namely all iblid vei tues/ogethcr with the operations or them, the Lord doth propound certainc fingalar virtues, or operations of vertues , which doe moft agree to his King-dome,and arc very remote from humane fence.and doth partly perfwade them by thepromileof bleflTcdneflc, and doth*^ partly al(b defcribe blcfledneflc, or bleflcd men, by the ftudy and profeffion of them.

24Thc c^mraon afFcftions of vcrtue, are thofe foure which are wont to be calledCardinall vertues. v

25. For they doe not make foure kinds of vertucs,as the ^ moft have hitherto thought, who doe manifcft violcnceboth to vcrtue and reafon it felfe^whilcftchcy will con(trainedly refer all fingular vertues to thoft heads : but they are foure conditions, whichare neccflarily required in that difpofition tiybich defcrvcs the name of vcrtue.

%6. The hrft of theft is called Juftice in that generall fenfe, whereby it fcts forth an inclination to doe rightly ^ giving A'/3 every



every man his own, and it may be called thercftitude of vcrtuc: for in that dcfcription of vertue which the Apoftic doth propound in a certainc heap of words, Phif,^,S. What* foever things arc true, whatfoevcr things are honelt, uhat-focver things are )uft, whatfoevcr things are pure, vvhacfb-ever things are lovely, whatfoevcr things are of good report, if there be any vertue , and if any prailc, akhrugh truth, Jurticc , purity doe fet forth one and the fame nature of vertue, yet Juftice doth moft intimately (cc forth the cffencc of it.

27. The focond is Prudence J whereby all theftrengthof reafon is u(cd to find out that which is right, and to direft a right all the meancs of it: ic is therefore the alone difcerning of thofe things which pertaine to right doing : and it coa-Caincfi in it (cifc the force of understanding, knowledge and and wifedome ; fo that all thole perfcdions of the mind which arc wont co be called intelleftuall vertucs,in this refpcA alone doc pertaine to vertue, fofar forth as by the power of then? the wili«dircftcd in doing well.

28. It is called in the Scripture Spirituall underftanding and wiiedome, O/ i^. Where underftanding doth feemc to fet forth a gencrall perceiving of good, and evill 5 and wit dome notes out the fame perceiving as it is applied to (cverall things coniidered with their circumftances, wherewith chcy arc clothed : fo that underftanding coniidering doth as it were fay, It is lawfull: wifdome faith^ It is expedient; according to that diftinSion which is, i Corinthians .6. 12.

29. This Prudence ought to be cxercifed, i. With cir-cnmfpeftion, caking heed and due diligence,which are often in the Scripture commended under the name of Watchful-ncffc. Marc^ 13.33«Take heed, watch and pray: unto which

30. The third generall affeaion of vcrtue isforCitude,which is a firme perfifting in doing rightly, enduring and over-comming all thofe difficulties which may arifc either from the continuance of the aft which is required^ or from other impediments whatfoever. Hence it is that vertue in the i^^-^r<?>j? is fet forth by the name Chriftjeven when it is aicribed to Women. Prov.^uio. And a mighty ftrengthning is required in every vertue. £ph.^,i6* It containes therefore, i. That confidence which is commended, nA^is 4. 29.

34. Yet becaufe every of thofe affeftions doc more appearc irffomc vertucs then in othcr^therefore fome fpcciall vertues doc take both their name and definition from them : for be-cautc an accurate rec^licudc doth moft appearc in the number:, mcafurc, weight, and valcw of thofe things which are mutually received andgiv^cn by man , therefore Juftice, in a certainc fpeciall manner is wont to be,^placed in things of fuch fort. And becaule thofe inconveniences are held moft terrible, which are wont to happen in warreaitd fuch like dangers, therefore the name of fortitude is wont to be re-^ ftraincd to (uch things. Becaufe the plcaiures of the fences are wont moft to ticklc^therefore temperance is for the moft part placed in them only ; although thole three together with Prudence taken in a.generall fence ^ are tied and folded ' together among thetnlclves^ as that Philofopher did ob-^ fcrve , who did firft almoft propound thofe foure heads ofvertues.

35 .Whereas the forme of vertue is placed by many in a certainc medioaity between two vices in the cxtrcame, that can be defended by no reafbn, i. Becaufe privation is not the forme of an habit; but mediocrity, is nothing clfe then a privation of a dcFcft and an excefle. 2. Becaufe the forme of vertue is to be fought in that conformity which it hath to his

Dd 2 rule J



rule :But this conformity doth neither only, nor chiefly, nor ibnactime at all confift in mediocrity. 3. Becaiife vertue in its formall refpcft cannot be too much intended, and fo doth not admit excelfe^ but either in that materiall thing which it hath common with vices, or in the circumftan* ces of operations , as when fome of them are cxcrcifed when they ought not, or arc not excrci(ed when they ought.

jd.Thatmeatie which is found in all vertues, is no other thing then a conformity to their rule, or meaftire: for by this they have ccrtainc mcafurcs and bounds in which their nature is as it were contamcd,fo that they may not decline to the right hand or to the left, but by this rcafon mediocrity is no more the forme of vertues, then of all other things which are difiinguiOied from other things by certaine formes and differences

57. But thofe vertucs which confift in the middle betwea two vicious habits 5 are not therefore vertues becaufe they confift in the middle, but becaufe they doe in that manner confift in the middle as their rule preCcribcs 5 in which manner , mediocrity whether of participation or negation, Rei vel rationi^.ofths thing, or of a relped, is to be confi-dered rather as a fubjeft matter) then as a perfetfling forme<t

38. Bat it is manifcft that fuch mediocrity bath no place in fome vertucs; for the love of God is not in that refpcft praifed that it is not too much^botthat it ismoft ardent, here themea-^* fure is without mea(ure»

39. There is the like reafon of all vertucs in refpcft of their proper and fpecificall nature. Hec that giveth when he ought not, is not too liberall: but he is too much in ^ givinp,{oth:n in that refpcft he ceafcthtobe liberall, and in ^ the fame aft he may be as much defective in not doing that which he ought.

40. The wilcmanindeedadmoniflicth, EccIef.j^iS^ThM we t e not Jiift overmuch, but this is not at all to be undcr-ftood of Jiiftice in its nature ( for it followes Verfe 20. That there is none juft upon Earth who doth good and linneih not) but as it is in opinion, whereby many docxhaUenge . ' too



too much to thcmfelvcs , and would have it attributed to Juftice : but intrucvercues we ought alwaycs to endeavour to thisjthat wc may more and more abound^as in the holy Scrip., tures we arc often admoni(hed.

41 •There be no degrees in vertue of one and the fame kind, if it bcconfidered ink felfe in thecxtent.For there is no vertue which at leaft in difpofition doth not extea i it ftlfc to all tholethings which are conrained in the compafle of itsob-jcft. He i$ not temperate which doth moderate himfelfein oneiultjand favours himlclte inochers^butinrcfpeiflofthe fubjcift fome vertue ia more ftrong in one then it is in another, eitherby reafonofa more apt difpofition by nature, orbe-caufc of greater accuftoming , or becaufe of a raorepcrfeft judgement of reafon , or finally becaufe of a geater Gift qI: G o D.

.^ . 42. i hat which is wont to be raid,that vertues are increafcd by daily ufe andexercife, that muft be lo underllood in iblid vertues proceeding from fanftifying grace, that day ly cxer-cilc is the difpofing caufe^and by vertue of the promife of God in fome fort the procuring caule, not principally or properly eflFcftingfuch an increale of vertue^

43*But vertues arc Icfllncd by the oppoHte vitious a(5l9, and in rcfpcft of the difpofition which they bring, and by reafon otthe merit that is in them.

44« By how much the afts of vertues, or contrary vices are more intenr,more frequent and more continual!, ft) much >, the more they prevaile,cither to the increafing or diminution of virtues.

45. Hence is that diftindion of vertues into humane and heroicall;into vertues purgingjpurged and exemplary : and of . thofe that are endued with vertue, into Infants, and men of < ripeagc.Hc^.^.ii, 14.

4<J. The communion of vertues is both intheconaexion and lubordination of them among themlelvcs.

47. For connexion is that whereby all vertues which arc fimply neceflary,doe cleave together among themfelves. i. In rcfpc6kof the beginning from whence they fiow:Forevcry good giving, and every perfeft gift defccndsfrom the Father of lights 5 By the fpirit of grace./^w^/1. 17, % Coni2.

1. In rcfpcft of the end and intention, which is to the fame thing in gcnerall ; for all vertues doe rorcfpcftGod^thatif his authority be violated in one, it is withall virtually violated in all, James 2. i o. j.In refpeft of that helping indea-vour which they performe mutually one to another. For one vcrtue doth difpofe to the aft of another ^ and alfo doth de* fend and confirm the fame with the aft.

48. Yet vertues are not fo cffcntially and intrinftcall]^ knit together^ that every one is of the eflence of the other, or doth necelTarily depend upon it as upon a procreating caule.

49*Subordination of vertues is that whereby the aft of one vertucis ordered to the aft and objcft of another , either as a mcanes to an end which is the command of a fuperior upon an inferior vcrtuc.as Religion commands Jufticc temperance, and thelikcj when it refers their afts to the furthering the worfhip and glory of God ; orasacaufetoitscfFeftj, whic'h belongs to every vertne in refpeft to every one i for fo Religion it felfe is ordained to bring forrfi and cbrtCerve Jufticee

5 0, Whenfoever the aft of one vertue is ordered to the end of another vertue , this ordination although in refpeft of the direftion it depends iipoh Prudence, yet in refpeft of the cffeftuall force and authority, it depends upon a fuperior vertue.

Thirdly,a good end,that is the glory of God, and tho(i things which tend unto his glory, i Cor. lo. 31. Doc all to the glory of God-

4* But the end and the objeft are oftentimes all one , both in good and evill aftions, efpecially in the intention and e-levfHon of the will ^ where they end ic felfe is the proper ob-jeft. For thofe ^6ls arc cither coBveyfanr in the en d it (clfe, as in the matter or objxft ^ as theafts of defiring, willing, wiQiingJovingjinjoyingjor iiitholc things which tend to the end as they are fuch/o as the goodncffe or deformity is pro' perly derived from the end. ..[^ -^ y ^ ;d ,

$., For although that good intention or intention of v?ell-' doing which isgenerall arKi coafufeddoth not make a particular aclion good , if other conditions be wanting : neither doth a fpeciall intention of good fuffice for it, if the meanes be evill: as if aay intending to bcftow any chingon the poorc or upon pious ufes (hould to chat end take to him-felfe other mens goods .' yet an evill intention doth alwayes make an aftion evill, and a good intention with other conditions doth make very much to the conftitution of a good aftion.

6. But there is required to an aftiQn truly good^that at leaft virtually it be referred to God, as to the chiefecnd.

7. In the fourth place alfo , there is required a forme or a good manncr^which is placed in the agreeing of the aftion to the revealed vVill of God.

13. By reafon of cbefe circurr.ftances it comes to paffe, that although many Afts in the generall or in their owne nature are indiffe'-cnt , ytt th» re is no Angular Aft that is morall , and deliberate , but it is eithei good or evill.

i^. An Aft in its kind indifferent is^when the objeft of it includes nothing which pertaiines to the will of God, either commanding or forbidding , yet fuch afti^ beujg in exercifc, feverally confidercdjif they be properly humane proceeding of deliberate reafon , are either dircfted to a dueend,and have conformity to the will of God, and (b are good : or they are not rightly direfted, but diflent from the will 01 God,and in «• that refpeft are evill.

17.Hence our good workes,whileft we live here,aie impcr-fcft and impure in themfelvcs.

18, Hence they are not accepted before God , but in Chrift.

2 5, The proper manner of honour, or religious worflhip is * tofubjedthe(bule ic felfe, and the inward afte£tions and ad«^ of the will to another.

26. For in refpeft of the (bule and inward afts of it,man is not fubjeft direftly and Perfeto any Creature, although as the foule is knit to the body ^ and the inward ads to the outward, his^ as it were neceflary^condition doth command that fubjcftion which is due to the Creature as a fuperior.

27. This honour is due to God, not only accordingto the agreement of the thing , in which fence we fay, thofe things^ are due which we give of liberality; but alfo according to the right of the perlon to whom it is given, and that by fo ftrift a rights that in refpeft ofthe debt it exceeds all Jufticc, although in refpeft of equality it is much exceeded bj Jultice.

28. Therefore all worfliip which either by its nature oc condition, or by Law^and common cuftome, or by the mind and inftitution of him that gives it doth give religious honour to another befide the true God, it doth To far forth at leaft faine to it felfe a new and a falfe God.

29. Hethatdoth not give this religious worfliip to God is prophane^he that gives it to another befides to the true God is an idolater, ABs iQ.RevfLig.io.3c 22.8. ^

30. But bccaule greateft care ought to be had in Divine* worfliip, therefore among the Latines the word religion is (omctime metaphorically ufed to fet forth any anxious care, even in things that were not facred. By which appeares that the Heathens thcmfelves by the light of nature did fee, that* the care of Religion is to bee prefered before all other / thing?.

31. Alfo becaufe the feare of confcience pertaines to the worfliip of religion^thereforcalfo every fcruple of conlciencc is wont to be called religion, whence alfo we may gather,that nature it felfe doth diftate that the confcience of a man doth firft and moft properly refpeft religion,

Hence that propofition is moft true^whatfoever we are bound to believe (with a Divine Faith) is true. For be-caufe nothing ought fo to be believed, uniefle God doe wit-neflethetruth thereof: but God teftifieth as he is true, but Tr^^«^/in a witnefle that knoweth all things^ cannot be ie-paratcd from the truth of the tcftimony; therefore it muft needs be, that all that which we arc bound to believe with a Disrine Faith/i$ true. This whole demonftration is manifcftly confirmed and ufed by the Apoftle PahL i Cor. 1 ?• 14.15. If Ghrift be not raifcd, our preaching is vaine : your Faith alfo is vaine; we are alfo found falfe witnefles of God; becauft we have witnefled of God.that he raifcd up Chriff. That is.

Uniefle this he sidmitted^that whatfoever God witnefJeth is truc^ thatcon-fcqucncf which is mofl firmc,(bould availc nothing at all,God doth witn^ffe this or that ^ therefore it is true. Hence Divine \ Faith cannot be a principle orcanf j^itherdircftly orindi-» re&Iy , either by it felfe or by acciaent^of aflenting to that which is falfcjOr of a falie affcnr.

But he doubted not at this promifc wT of God through unbeliefe ; but he was ftrengthcnd in Faith, giving glory, to God, and being fully perfwaded that he that had prottxif d,was able alfo to doe it.

ap. Therefore Divine Faith cannot be reduced or rcfolvcd into the authority of the Chu^ch.or into other Hnipic ex= er-nall arguments which are wont to be called iMotivtj by perfwading and inducing things preparing to Faith ; but it is to be rcfolved into the Scripture It lelte, and thatauthoriry which it hach imprinted upon it from the author GodjaN into' the firftand proper caufe which c^uicth the i hing to bf belfc-vcd 5 and into the operation of th^ holy Spiric, as iflto tt&e proper caufc of the aft it (cite believing.

3. But the proper reafon why we may not truft upon the Creatures, in that manner as we truQ in God j is becaufe the formall objeft of Hope is not found in the Creatures. PfaU 14& J.

8.

If we hope for whatweftc not,we doe with paticace expcft it. According to my earneB expectation and hopcj and every where in the old Teftament^ where the word Mikj»eh which is wont to bf turned^ Hope, doth properly figniHe expeftation.

9.1 his certainty is derived to Hope from Faith : for Faith is the foundation of Hope j neither is any thing hoped for, which is not before believed by Faith. GalatUns 5,5, For, wc through the fpirit^ wait for the Hope of righteoufnefle by . Faith.

10. For feeing Faith apprehends that which is promifid, and Hopeexpefts that which is promifed ; the whole difference between Faith and Hope, is the re(pe^ of chat which is pefentj and that which is to come.

11. Therefore that diftinftion of the Papifts is eapty and vaincjwho granting that the faithfull may be certaine of their fahration with certainty of hope, yet doe deny, that they can # ever by ordinary meanes be made certaineotil with certain* ty of Faith, when there is one and the fame certainty altogether of Faith and Hope : for which reafon alfo itis^that Hope in Scripturc,e(pccially in the old Teftamentjis often put\ for Faith.

i2» Therefore that expeftation of good things to come ( which is in the Angells , and the fpirits of Juft men in Hca-ven^dosh not in that differ from our hopCj^becaufe one is cer-taine^and the other iriCertaine: but in theft. i.Th^ our hope is grounded upon Faith, which beholds God in thepromifts as through a glafle, and darkly, xCora^.tz.

i3.Thcrcforc although Hope together with Faith is wont to be faid to be abolifhcd in thelifc to come: yet this is not fo to bcundcrftood^as ifthey ccafed to be in reipeft of their effencc^ but only inrcfpeft of the meafure and degree of imperfcaiop. I Cor. 13.1 o. So that the imperfeftion only is properly to be aboli(bcd ; but Faith and hope itfelfearetobepecfeaedin rcfpeft oi thrir cflcnce.

i4.Hencc Chriftian confidence as it refpefts good to come, is nothing clftthen Hope confirmed^ For it muft neceflfari-ly be rcferrcJ to fome one of thole theologicali vcrtues which are reckoned up by the Apoftle. 1 Cor.t^.i^.

15. Hence the naturali fruit of Hope is Joy, and delight in God, Heb.^.6. The hope whereof we rcjoyce. iPet.i.^. 6. A lividy hope, wherein yec rcjoyce. Becaufe it doth reipeft the grcateft good things, not only as poffible and probable, but alfo as certainly to come, and fo doth make the poflcifionofthemiriacertainc manner to iubfijft, whileftit doth aifurc us of that w-hich at kngth ihall in very deed fubiift. ^ Rc.S 24,Wc are faved by Hope,

16. The manner of this aft depends upon that rdfpeft of the objcft,whcrebyitisfaidto be, to come ^ and pro-mifed. So that in its formallreafonjit is not of tho(c things which are feenc. Romans 8.24. Hope if it be feene, is not Hope ; for w4ty doth a man hope for that which ,hec fecth>

18. A fruit of this patience is filcn#c, whereby we reft in the will of God, and doe reprefle all thofe carnall thing* whereby we are ftirred up to make haft, or to rcfift him. P/^/. 37.7. Be filent to i^^^v^^, and without ceafing waite on him.

19. Hope IS ftrengthencd and increased , by all thofe arguments, whereby we are aflured that the good hoped for pcrtaints to us.Rom 5.4. Experience caufeth Hope.

20. Among thefe arguments the inward fignes of Divine grace have the firft place, i lobn 3.14.19. We know that we are tranflated from death to life, becaufe we love the breihrec*

II. Therefore although it is moft falfe which the Papiftt fay,that our hope is grounded partly upon thegrace of God^ and partly our own merits, it may be moft truly affirmed, that hope is ftrcngthcnedjincreafed and ftirred up^by Faithjrepen-tance, workes and a good confciencc. So that true and lively hope doth exift by thofe as it were antecedent arguments. HfL 10.22.23. I Pet.^.2i.

22^ The cffed of hope is the confirmation of the foule as an anchorjfafe, andfirme. H«^^*^.i9, Whereby Wcpoflcflcour very foules. Luc.7 1.19#

23. There followes alwayes from this confirmation of mind a ftudy of holincfle. i John 3.3, Whofoever hath this hope in him,keepcth himfcJfe pure,cven as he is pure.

24. There is oppofed to hope by way of defeft. i. A fcarc' of the cvill of puniftimcnt, P/a/. 27^ 3. For as Hope is the expedation of good, fo this feare is an expeftation of cvill. ^

25. But this fearcjif it be moderate and tempered by Faith, although it be alwayes materially oppoicd to Hope, yet ( in man that is a (inner, it is not fo formally oppofcd to Hope ^ andvertue, that it is fimply a vice, but rather puts on the confideration and nature of a vcrtue, ^(^hrcyj. 34.27. Becaufe thy heart v^as tender,and thou didft caft down thy felfc before the Face of God j when thou heardeft his words againft this place, &c. Thcreafon is becaufe the oppofition is not^SccHndum idem^ & adidem^ according to the fame^and

26. Alfodefpcration is more dircftly oppofed tohopc^ inthedcfeftj^which is a mcereprirationof hope joyned with I fence of that privation , and apprehcnfion of the thing hoped for, as of a thing impoffible, or atlcaltaBtocoaie, fuch as was in Kainc, Qon.^.i^^i^. And in luda^. OMat* 27. 4 $•.

ajt This dcfperation i« alwayes a grievous fin : bccaule it U not a privation of that hope which men are wont to have inthemfelfes or other Creacurcs , which is wont to be a laudable introduftion to Divine hope, but it is a privation ofDivinehopCjhaving its beginning alwayes from unbelicfe, as hope hath its beginning trom Faith.

28. Yet defperation in the Devilis and damned, hath not the confideration of a fin, but of a punifliment. For defpera-tion may either be taken privatively when one doth not hope that which he ought to hope, and when he ought, or negatively for a meere ccflTation of hope. In the former fence it is alwayes a fin, becaufe it is contrary to the Law, but in the latter (encc not (a

29. The reafon of defpairing may be diverSjeither bccauft the grace of God is not accounted fiifficient to communicate |hat good to us, or becaufe God will not communicate itt As defpcration is grounded on the former reafon,it is alwayes a fin, but in the latter fence it is not a fin % if fo be any be cer-

30. Buc becaufe it is (cldomc orncvermanifefttoanyonc by ordinary meanes before the end of this life, that God ^will not make him partaker of graccand glory : Therefore there is no de(pcration of men in this life which is not a finne«

31. Byway of excefle prefuinption is oppofed to hope, whereby wee doe expcdl Ibme good rafhly. Dent^ 29. 19. Jerq.^^^.9. 10. Let there not be iany man, when he hath heardj&c-

33. But one doth not therefore (in in this prcfumptionj b6* caufe he hopes too mach upon God, namely with a true and religious hope 5 for this can in no wife be done: but becaufe he hopes too lightly and raftily without any ground,or hopes thofe things alfo which are not to be hoped.

18. The manner ofour Charity towards God is that it be caricd to bioi, as to that which is iimply the higheft good and end ; fo that neither God ^ nor the love ot God is principally and laftly to be referred to any thing eife : becaUfe fuch love (hopld be mercenary, ^ohyi 6.26. Ye leekc me^becawfe yec ate otthe loaves and were filled.

19. Yet wee may love God as our reward. Gen^fis 15. 7. And with refpeft of other good things, as of a reward. Gen. 17.2.

ao. The degree of Charity cowards God ought to be the higheftjfirft in refpeft of theobjc&j or as they (ay objeftivcly, that is, willing a greater good to him then to any. 2. In regard of eftecme, or as fome fpeake, appretiatively^that is, pre-terring him and his will before all other things, even our own iife. Mat. i o. J7. Lhc.i^ 26. So chat we rather choofe to die thqn to tranfgrcflc even the leaft ofhisQommande-ments. g, Intenfively, that is, in refpeft of the vehement in-dcavour, in the appHcation ofall the faculties to the loving of God* "Dent. 6. $. Thou (halt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all t{iy raind, and with aU thy ftrength. . . , /

21. According to this defcription of Charity it is rightly *{aid of (bme Divines, that God is only to be loved; that is, fimply 5 by it felfe and according to all the parts of Charity (namely with afFcdion of gooa will, defire of Union , and Nvel-plcafedne(re of enjoying in the higheft degree ) although our neighbour alfo is to be beloved in a cercaine refpeftjfor another thing,in part and in a lower degree,

22. To this Charity is oppoled that feare which liath tor-ment,by the prefence of God and feare of punifhment to be in-^ iiidted by him,x Iohn^.i%. Perfcft.love ca(teth out feare : be-caufe feare hath torment.

23. Hence Charity being perfeftedcafteth out feare* li^id^ Becaufethat feare is an horror arifing from the apprehenfion of cvill, by reafon of the prefence of God : and fo is oppofed

to Charity, which is caricd unto God, a3 unto diat which is ab(olutly good.

^4.rf Secondly, there is oppofed to it an^enftranging from Gpdjwhich is called by fomc hatred of abomination* ^faL i^^j, Iohn:^.%o. They art all gottebut of the way.

2 5. For although if God be apprehended lo as he is in himlelfe, he cannot be the objeft of hatred 5 yet as he is apprehended as one that caketh vengeance on {inners,fo far forth he is often hated of the fame finners : becaufc in that rcfpe(ft he is moft contrary to them, loh, 3.20. Whofoever evill doth^ hateth the light, neither commtth to the light,leaft his deed* be reproved. For as the love of God is in the godly thecaufi that they hate impiety contrary to God 5(0 the love of ini-i[uity in the ungodly caufeth that they hate God as contrary to their iniquity.

of hearing" of the PVord.

I. ■ ^Rom thefe vertucsof Religion towardsGod.Faith,

r-4 EJope^and Charity^therc arifeth a double aft of R.eli-

JP^ gionwhichrefpeftsthatfpirituallcommunionwhkh

is cxcrcijfed betwecnc God and us: Hearing of the word ^ and

Prayer.

, 2* The reafon or foundation of this diftribution is in this^ that we doe afEsfl: God with religious worfhip, when wc yeild him due honour, whether this be by receiving^ that which he himfelfe propounds to us, or fey offering that which maybe received by him according tohisperfcftion^forin both refpe(Sts we dpe that which is immediatly, and difcftly honorable to God* .

3. The firft aft of Religion therefore Is about thofe things which arc communicated to us from God : and the other is about thofe things which ai e yeilded to God from us.

4. Hearing the word is a religious receiving of the will ^^God; ;.;;•• *, 1 -" . :^-;i ^: ::hi:otr : /: tor."

^ 5. Therefore hearfng is here taken fdr any receiving oft he words of God , whether they be com^iunicated to us by preaching, or by reading,orany other way , becau(e God is* wont to worke in a lingular manner, and by hisowxiinftituti*; * on in the preaching and hearing of the Word. o -.re!* ^ i.7 .6. Thereforeihis word ought not tobetakenfoftri(5Hy^ that it (bould either chiefly, or neceflarily include alwayey the outward fence of hearing: but that it may note any per-i cieving of the will of God, and chiefly fet forth an inward -jeoeiying and fubjeftion.

, y 7^The receiving of the Word confiftsof two parts,: Attention of mind,and intention of will.

8. Attention is an applying of the underftanding to perceive the revealed will of God. ASls 16.14. The Lord opened the heart of Ljdia , that fhe might attend to the things which JitV.i aO :[':\ were



were (pokcn by Vaul. It is often called in the Scriptnrc.cfpe-cially in the Old TclUment, A fteking of the will of God, or of God himfelfe, to fet forth that great dclire wherewith wcQiould be carried to know Gods Will, as to the finding out offome thing which we can by no meanes want.£/^j 58, 2.Yet they (eeke me dayly , and delight to know my waycs; as a Nation which doth lighteoufnefle and doth not forlakc the judgement ot their God, they inquire of me the ordinances ofjuftice, they delight in approchingtoGod.

pjn this attention there neederh that providence whereby we may difcerne, whatthatis that God willeth./?^w.i2. 2. That yee may prove what is that good, pleafing, and perfect Will of God : which when it is perceived^we muft not deliberate further^ whether it be good , or to be obferved or no : for the will ot God it feUe is the laft bound of all religious inquiry* Gal. 1.15. i6> When it pleafed G o i> to rcveale his Sonne in mee , I did not confult with flefli and blood*

lo.lntention is an applying of our wilto a religious ob(er-vanccofthe will ot God already perceived. T7^/.i J 9.106. I have fworn and will performe it^.that I will keepe thy righteous judgement.

11. 1 he purpole of the intention ought to be (b ftrong

and firme, that without all exception we be ready to ob-

(crve whatfoevcr God will command, i^r.42.5,^6. The Lord

' be a true and faithful! witneflTe betweene us, if we doe not

\even according to all things for the which the Lord thy

God (hall fend thee to us: whether it be good^ or whether ic

. b€evill5WC will obey the voyceof the Lord our Gcd.

12* In refpeft of this intention the Law of God itfelfeis /aid to be in the heart of abcliever.7y^/40,9,&%ii9.i I. fer. 51, 55.He^*8.10.

I3» This hearing that it may be right, ought to be fronr religious obfervance, bringing fubjeftion of the inward aftSg and inclinations of the mind. Romans 6^ \j. From the heart yee obeyed that forme of doftrine to which yee were delivered.

14. But that it may be truly religious. It is requifitej firft that it arife from Faith, whereby we believe that to be the

H h 3 word



word of truth which God revcales unto us , and alfo are accordingly affefted toward if. Hebr,^.!. The word being heard did not profit thcro, not being mingkd mth Faith in them that heard it.Lur.2^:^2.Did not our heartsbUrtte inu« whilelt he fpake to us ? ' - ^^ -

15. By this Faith weckave to the vvord.T/V.n^.juAlii the word it (e!fc cleaves unto,and is ingrafted in us^unto faJva* tion^Iames i,2uThat^^^grafted word.

16. Secondly the fame hearing muft flow frxjm that hopc^ whereby we doe embrace that which God hath pi omifed as the word of life ^ alfo cxpeding life by it, De^st. 52. 47. John 5. 59. It is your life, ycc lookc in them to finde eter-nail life.

17. By this hope it comes to pafle that the faichfuU bring forth fruit with patience. Lur.S. 15.

18; In like manner it muft have love joyncd with itjwherc-by we cleave to the fame word, or to God reveali? gbim-felfe to us in that word as limply good.P/^/.i 19.97.H0W doe I love thy Law. iTheJf.2.10^ They received not the luve of thetmtb^tbat they might be fared.

19. Inrefpeftof this love the Word of God doth dwell plentifully in the faithfull, CoLJftans 3* 16. So as they are alio transformed into the forme and falbion of it, Romans 6. 17.

20. Such an hearing of the Word of God is the true^ an«l proper worfliip of God. i. Becaufe it doth immediacly and dire^ly bring fpirituall honour to God 3 for although.* the aft of hearing is mod properly direfted to our receiving of the Will of God , yet becaufe in the manner of receiviilg we doe fubjeft our consciences to God, therefore we give bim that honour of power 5 and Divine truth in the acknow-^ ledgement whereof his religious worfliip is exercifed. 2, / Becaufe it cont^neth a direft, and immediate, exercifeof'^ Faith, Hope, and Love, in which the worftiip of God dotb moftcflentially coafift.

2 i.Hence no word or icntenceof men, ought to be mingled with the word of God^ and propounded in the (ame manner with it, leaft by this meaner we doe i»fomc (brt worfliip men inftcadof God.

22. Unto



22. Unto this hearing that pride Is moft formally oppo-fed whereby one doth Co affcft h is ownc excellency, that he will not be fubJTftto the Will of God. For although this pride is coiicrary Co hiiri)ilicy of religion, and obediericc, or obedience in gencrall, yet it fcemcth to be moft properly op-pofitetotheminthis aft of religion : becaufe a proud man,^ as he is fuch, is fo far from fufcjcding himfcUe to the will of another, as to a Law, that he would have his own will ih fteadof a Lai^r. lerem.i 3, 15. Heareand giveeare: be not proudjfor the Lord hath fpoken«/(?r.5.5.They have broken the yoke, t4iey have burit the bonds.

25* The proper aft as it wereof this pride is that contempt wli^reby one doth (et at naught either Ood or the Will of God and obfervanceof it. 2 S.tm.12.9. Why haft thou dcfpifed the Word of the Lord ^ in doing that which is cvill in his Eyes.

24. Hence pride is faid to be the caUft of all other fins, for a double reafon. u Becauft all or her (innes are referred in jrcertaine mannw to that cxtdlency whicN is feene in pride a^ to an efid. 2 JSecaufe pride caft^cch aWay from it felfe in con*-tempt the government of the wordj by the power whereof alone fin i^ avoyded#

25. Hence there is in every fin found ftfiie refpeft of pride, bat efpcciaily in- thofe which are committed upon deliberate €Oun(cll»

26* Hence alfo all confultation with the world 5 flcQi ot

Vifdomc of the fleftx in tkoie things which pertaine to relrgi-

"ein, is oppofed to the hearing of the Word. Rom^trnt. 7.

27. For as by pride men doe tltogethcrrefnfetofubjedl themfclves to the will of God .* So by thefe confultations of thofc things which are not after God , they doc feckc to themfclves as it were other GodSj to whom they maybe fubi:ft.

28. The moft accurftd oppofition to hearing of the word of God IS inconfulting with the Devillj. Slay S^i^.Deut. 18.11.12,13,14,! 5. Where a certaine religious Faicb^andHopc due to God only is transferred cither explicitly or implicitly to the enemies of God.

2f • HeUci



If. Hence it is that Faith is wont chiefly to be required in fuch confultations by thofe who are the mafters ot (iich Art?. /

30. By vertue of this Faith there is a certainc cowant en-tred into with the Devill, with fame religiorjif not openly and expre(rively>at leaft fecretly and implyediy. \ 31. But although one have not a direfl: intention to aske counieli of the D^vili, yet if he doc that which either of itsowne nature, or by u(e and application which it hath doth infer a compellation of the Uevill to receive his hclpc or counlelljhe is made partaker of the fame fin.

32. Therefore all arts brought in by inftinft of the Dcvill, for the knowing of fecrets arc in this re(peft to bee con-^ demned.

56. The kinds of prayer are two.Petition , and thank(^ giving. Phil* 4. 6. In every thing let your requefts be made knowne to God in prayers, and deprecation, with giving of thankes. J

57. Petition is a prayer of that which is wanting,that we mayobtaine it, LMatthew 7.7. A8ke,and it ihall be giveit you : Seeke^and yceftiallfinde 5 Knock^and it (hall be opcr ned to yout ^ # V 58. Alwayesthat which we askeis wantingjcieherwholj^*^^ or in part or in our feeling^or finally in refpeft of the ad, or in .1^ rcfpeft of the continuance of it.

59.: Hence 3 a fence of our emptinefic and want, togcthei^. with an apprchenlionot fufficicncy,whereby our infiifficiency ^ nnay be Supplied 9 is neceflarily required to make a pctitlT • on aright. ^: ^ ' : i: ri:; . j^.^o^-ml; -i ^i:. %: i :^.l .c;^

60. The vertuc and efficacy of petition is not ihdefertingj or in (ati«fying, as the Papifts would have it>but in impetrati^ ononely*

61. To impctrate is properly to have the force of a meaneS to obtainc fomc good freely from another.

''^ '^' <2.There-



61 .Thcrforc all good works,or all obfcrvanccjalthough kz it floives from Faich, hath fome power toobtaine blelllngs from God 5 by vertucof that proraife, whereby he appointcth a free reward to them ; whence alfo Reall Prayer ditiitiguifh-ed from vocall and mcntall, is called by fome a good worie, although very improperly : yet petiiion, doth obtaine.in a fpecial manncr,not only as it is a chiefe part of obedicncc^buc alio bccaufe it bath in its proper nature this e.id and ufe, asic, is aformall aft ofFaith and hope^by which we receive all good ^ things from God. ,., ^ ■ ,... ^

^5..Fetitionibecaufe it doth mol^ ,|'9rmally flow From; Faith and Hope, therefore it is in the fanie manner converfaotj about good things to be asked as thofe vcrtues arc con-verfant about their fecundary objecfls, that is 5 thofe things, irhich they apprehend , arc to bee communicated to us froEftGod.

66. Hence thofe things onely are to bs asked abfolucly which are neceffary for Gods glory and our falyation : but other things with a fccret fubjeftiontotheraoftwifedifpo-fingofGod*

67. Hence both the manner, aad particular time co cota-piunicatc this or that upon U8, ought not to be prefcribed to C5o3 in our prayers 5 yet it is lawful! to pray God to keare ^^ipeedily, P/alme 102.^. Hearc m^fpcedily. Bccaufe hec hatn promifcd to doc this^ Luk^ 18. 8, Hee will avenge them quickly. Yet wee maj not define the fit time of this

/fattening.

> 68. B"^ becaufe petition flowes alfo from Charity^ hence

thofe things alfo are to be defired, and asked in prayers,

which doc moft make to the celebration of the glory and

goodnefleofGod,

6^. Hence alfo we askc not only for our felves, but for all

©ther alfojwho cither arc or may be partakers with us of the

fame goodnefliof God.iT/w.a.i,2i3.

7aThc Patriarchs and Prophets did not only in their bicf-^ K k fings



fings pray well when they uttered their dcfires^ but alfo did promifc well in the name of the Lord; the Hebrew words arc wont to conuine both , Let God givc^or God fliall give. C^f^.27.30.

71. Therefore aUhough wc may not peculiarly pray for the deadj becaufe fuch prayer hath neither precept nor commendable example in Scriptures* nor finally any u(e orcnd: neither may we pray for alland every one living colledivcly that they may be faved ; becatife we know the contrary is dc-termined by God^yct we ought not wholly to rcjeft any maa living in particular from the communion of our prayers^ neither for any enmity^ ttor for GODjcftures,or probable fignes of reprobation.

72.Petitionis twofold according to the refpeft of the ob-jeft or thing which is asked : for it is either Apprecation, or Deprecation.

73. Apprecation is petitioning for good things to be communicated.

74. Deprecation is petition for cvill things to be rcnfioved. Intcrccffion which is joyncd to thefe twoj i Tmf.2. i. is a peculiar manner of deprecation, namery,^when th^evill which we defire to be removed is placed in foitte injury, dont by men.

75. Ur to deprecation there belongs. Complaints and lamentation Sja^kdjunfts of it. '

7(5.GDtoplairtt is a fignificatiBn of otirgrWfr, oftoifcriei as they are in jdrioufly inflifted by men. -^

77. Unto thefe complaints impfecatioii is fometime^dy^X' Bed, whereby we wifti tome evill to thofc who areauthori ^ ofevill. But this is ordinarily no farther hwlull,th<fn as;t hath the force of deprecation, for the removing feme greater cvitl by that cvill which we m(h to them, but the propisieti-* call imprecations were alfb prcdifti'>ns.

78.Lam€ntation is a fign'fira:lonofourgriefe,oftho(c rci-fcries as they are fcnt by Gu J.

79.Someame failing is added to deprecation as an outward adjunct.

80. Fading is an abftihcnce from the helpes and comfort$ ©f this life 3 whereby humility is (hewed as it were in t rcah

confeflion.

82 HenctralfbthefaRje mcafureandumeoffaftingisnot equally profi able, and nccefTary to all and every one,

of an Oath.

I. r I ^Here be two manners of petition to be ufed upon I occafion^which were brougiatin by reafon of mans JL infirmity : an Oath, and a Lot.

2. But becau(e theft two manners are brought in upon fuch occafion, therefore they mull not be ufually frequented^ but then only to be u(ed where humane neceffity requireth, and a waighty and juii cauft is in hand,

3. An Oath is a requefting of Gods Teftimony to con-firmethctruthofour teftimony.Ht?^.d.i3,i6. Men fweareby him who is the greater: and an Oach for confirmation is to them an end of all ftrife.

4. An Oath became neceflary after the fall of man, becaufc man by fin had loll both that credit which ought to be given

* to his fimple teftimony,and that alfo which he ought to have ^iven to the teftimony of others.

5. Thac iiifirmity of man in giving credit to the teftimony of other^is fo great that it was in a manner neceflfary for God himfelfeaUo todemeanc hinHclfe to confirmehisteftimonies,

Chapter X I.

of n Lot.

1. A Lot is i rctjufcfting of a Oivinc tcftimony to decide A\ forac controverfyjby the deterrtiining of an event t;6

JL JLbcmanifefted in a mcere contingency. Pro, i6.^jl The Lot is caft into the lap : but the whole difpofition pf it is of the Lord. And 1818, A Lot mdketh contenyomtoccafej^^ Mddecfdeth gmong the'mighty.' > ♦'' * ^:^ C' r:.

2. We call it a requcft: btcauftit hath that natdre, that h cxpcfts that ufe to which it ferves from God alone; and in that rcfpeft it h«th an immediate refpcft to his providence.

3. WedeFne it by contingency, that we may avoid the error of thofe, who place the common confidcrstioti of a Lot Sntha^ manner of the efficient caufc^w hereby it h faki to work by fortune.

4. For there are many fortatfouscanlcs which docalto-^eclier differ from the corrfideration of a Lot .- as when be fcxids gold; who digging fought for cofcs : alfo there ai«

manv



many Lots wherein fortune is no afting caufc, as when the Lot depends upon the flying of birds , or fome fiich like efFcd:s,which is produced by a caufe that workec of ics ownc power.

5. Neither can it be Logically defended^thac the very caft of a Die, or (bme fuch like efFeft upon which depends the confideration of a Lot,is alwayes befide the intention or (cope of the agent, which yet is neccffarily required^ to fortuitous chance.

d. But v/e dqe not place a Lot fi^ply in contingency^ but in meere contingency : bcciufe there are three degrees of things contingent: fome often happening^fome feldonie, and (bmefo far as we can underftand^equally having thcmfelves on cither part : for in other Contingents there is fome place left to con/edure by art : but in meere contingency there is none.

7. It is not therefore a fortuitous manner of the efficient caufe which is faid to rule in Lots, but either that blind fortune which was made a goddefle by profane men , and placed in Hea vendor the fpeciall providence of God, working that way that is hidden to us.

8. But feeing chat in erery Lot there is foughtthe determi-nation of fome queflion or controverfy, and it is fought by sneere contingency, in it felfe and in icfpeft of us, altogether undetermined 5 in muft need^ b^^thac the very determination it (elfe (what(*.>cver the a^uall iatention of men (hall be )

%e from the nature of the thin?, alwayes fought from an higher Jbwcr, having power 10 dirc^!^ fuch contingencies, bycer-tiinecounfeU : ^ndfoin^ery deed the ufc of a Lot is an appealing alwayes either to the true God, or to fomefaigned power, which is wont to be {tt forth by many by the name of fortune.

(js. When tnerefore our DiYines dee teaeh that there is a ccrtaine extraordinary pjrovidence of God fet oyer all Lots, they arenc* io to be taken ^ as if cither thofe that ufed Lots did alwayes djrcftly, and diftinSly refpcft (iich a providence, or as if .God did alwayes eKreife foch a providence: but that the Lot it felfe, of its own nature hath a ccrtainc rcfpeft CO the fingtdar, and extraordinary providence of God

L 1 a is

r til



in diredling of an event mecrly contingent, and in thii fence their fcntence is moft true.

10, For feeing that in a Lot fomc judgement isexpefted by the common confcnt of all, and there is no power of giving judgement- in contingent events, neither is there any other fortune judging then the certainc providence of God, itmuft needs be that this judgement be in a finguUr manner expefted, from Gods providence.

\ I. Neither can meerc contingency It felfe have the refpcft of a principall caufe in deciding any queftion : neither can man to whom the event it felfc is meerly contingenti direft it to attaine fiich an end- Itmuft needs be therefore that luch dirc<ftion be expefted of fome (iiperior dire&or.

12. Ad hereunto, that (iich is the order of proceeding in mans inquiry, that when men defire fome queftion to be determined , and they have not certaine^eanes in their powsr for this detcrmination^they feck it from (bme Ciperior power: »nto which manner of proceeding the confideration of a Loc doth altogether agree.

13. Neither can it ftand, that he that worketh by Coanfell, intending; a certaine end andfcope, bycertaine reafbn^can fubje<fl his aftion, cither to fortune or meerc contingency as it is fuch : for fo counfell ftiould be without knowledge, and indifferency undetermined ftiould bee a raeanes of a caufe determined.

14. Suchanexpeftation and refpcft to the fingular pro^ vidence of God is raanifeftly taught. Prov. 16. Firr/l jj^^ Whileft the aftion of every man about a Lot, is affirmed to \ be bounded in meerc contingency* The Lot is caft into the lap, and in accurate difccrning the whole judgement is referrtd to G o d. But all the difpofition ot ic is from the Lor ?.

15. For although all things are otherwi^ referred onto God*^ providence in the Scriptures: yet nothing is wont to bc re^rrrcd u roic with fuch difceniing^ unleflc it have a certaine linpu'.^r rcfpccfl: unto it*

i6.>]» irherdoth tc any thing hinder,that the Hr^rrmword tM'^ch?h,ith is f^meri^ic wont to ^gnifie another thing bc-fideJ jdgement; bccaule ic muft alwayes be taken according

. to



to the fubje<5l matter, and there is a certamc judgement given to Lots by all who dcfcribe the nature of chem.

17. Hence therefore a Lot ought neither to be ufcdraftly, nor in fportingor lighter mattcrSj nor in thofc controverfics which are cither vainer^ or can be decided fitly by other ordinary meanes.

18. Neither therefore it is to be ufed ordinarily or without fpeciall revelation, to divining, nor to coofiilt of a right, nor ordinarily of a deed that is paft 5 but of a divifion to be madcorofaneleftion lawhill on both fides, which cannot othcrwife be fo fitly determined^that they whom it conccrncf would be pleafed.

i^. The opinion of them who defend playing Lots is (iifficiently refuted by this one reafon, that f by the confent of all) a Lot hath a naturall fitneflc to aske counlell of Gods providence in a fpeciall manner. For it cannot be that one and the fame aftion of its own nature fhould be fpecially apt to fo (acred an ufcjand yet withallfttould be applied to jefts, andplayes.

20, That reafon whereby it is contended, that the uft of a Lot is lawftill in light and playingmacters, becaule it is lawfully u(ed in thole civil! controverfies which are of lefler moment, hath no conftquence : for although thofe civill controverfies in which a Lot hath place, of thcmfelvcs arc not grcat^yet are maie very great by the.confequences Joynedwith them or adhering to them •* which cannot be affirmed of thofe fpirting contentions.

21, The tithes ofthe living Creatures.£^z;*i7.52. The orders of prictHy and Lcviticali admioiftraiions,! Chron. i6. 1^14. Sec. LucA.9. Mi^ht bring with ithcm great inconveniences, unleffe they had been determined by fome Divine (cntcnce : and in that refpeft they were appointed by Lot by Gods inftitution.

%2h It doth not appeare from the nature of Lot?,that they doc mod agree to the lighteft things : for although wc may not cxpev"^ G jd^i fpeciall determination unlcfle we have before done lb much as in us is to decide the queltion,propounded by ordinary meanes, yet by that ourindeavnur waightineffeis cither not removed from the concrovcrfic k lclft>or not to be conunictcd to a Lota LI 3 23*The



Ofatot. 13. TheverynatureofaLoti«holy,af of an Oath4 therefore there is no need that it ftiould receive fpcciall fanftifi-cation from any fpcciall inftitution. For although that contingency which is as it were the matter of a Lot ^ is not of its owne nature holy, as neither Bread nor Wine ought to be fo efteenricd; yet in application to its ufe^it putteth en a cei> tainc fanftity, as the words of an Oatbi and the elements in the Sacraments^

24. It is indeed free foe Chriftians to ufe the Creatures to thole ends to which they are naturally apt, or made apt. But meere contingency hath no aptitude of it felfe to determine any queftion, neither doth i: taVeam .^pntudeby thcconfentofthemwho ufe it to that cr.d. ¥01 uuhofeLots which are called extraordinary, aiid arc acknowledged to depend upon God, and not upon men ; the iame com-(ent is had in the fame manner ^ and yet it addes nothing to a Lot.

a $• None can fhcw that a Lot is indifFcrent.unlefle be (hall 6rft demonArate that there ^s in it no (peciall appealing tp Gods providence.

26. Although alfo the matter of fporting things, is npc tied to this or that kind of indifferent aftions, yetithatk thole bounds (et to ic felfe, that it can have no place im thofe thirgs which doe Angularly pertaine to communion with God.

27. Itis altogethervaine which is ob'efted5 that a Lot often repeated wil have a divers cvcnt;fornei. ic* isthislikeJyi^ if a Lot can be righ tly iterated, neither dcrh every appea"^ ling to Gods provid ncc neceflarily bring with it his fpeci all operation : and yet God even out of orccr is read to have (bmstimcs anfwcred diveifly to thole, by whom he wasunfta-(bnafely tcmpted*iV;/w^,22* 12.3o.Goe not with them .

31. But chofe humane cxcrcifcs which are grounded upon art, bur are in pare fubjeift to calualty in the progreflc, doe greatly differ from D.ce.

;j2« Whereas men are wont, by playing at Dice to b^ ftir-red up to fweanngs , curfings , and blafphcmies, more then in other exercifes, this commeth partly from the nature of the play it felfc : becaule the Lot being often reiterated and often failing expeftation s they thinkc that that power which they L»agine doth governe the Lot , i% a-gain(i them.

17. The meancs which God hath ordained in this kind, (bme of them doe properly, and immcdiatly make to the exercifing and furthering of Faith.Hopeand Charity; as pab* lique and folcmne preaching of the word, celebration of Bap« tilme^ and the Lords Supper, and prayer*

And fomc of them are mcanes for the right performance of thofc former, as the combination of thefaithfullintoccr-taineCongregations or ChurGhcs.Eledionj Ordination, and Miniftration of Minifters ordained by God^together with the care of Ecclefiafticall Difcipline. ..lu;. .

iS.Thoft former are moft properly the hiftitoted worfliip of God 5 yet the reft arc alfo worfhip, not only in that gcne-fall fefpet^jas all things are faid to be ads ofwor(bipand religion, which doe any way flow from , or are guided by religion ; but alfo in their fpeciall nature ^ becauie the adequate end and ufe of them is, that Go^ii may be rightly ivofftjipped.

19. All thcfe therefore both in generally and in (peciall ought to be obfcrved of us as they are appointed by God | for God muft be worftiipped by us with disown worfliip, totally and (blely^nothing mull here be added, taken away or changed. D^/vr. 12.31.

10. That is a very empty diftinftion, whereby fbmegoc ^ nbout to excufc their addition8.Tbat only addition corrupt-• "v • Ing, and not addition conferving is forbidden 5 becanfe ^ ^ every addition as well as detraftion is exprefly oppofcd to ob-fervation, orconfervation ofthe commands of Godjas being a corruption.D^/^M2.32.

21. Of like ftampe alfo is that evafion whereby thtsy^y there is forbidden only addition of eflentialls, and not of 'A'ccidcntalls : for firft although there be accidents or cer-taine adjunfts of worfliip, yet there is no worfliip to fee ifeftply called accidentall , becauft it hath in it the very - ififenceof worfliip.

23. There is oppofed unto this inftitutcd worlhip, as unlawfull, that will-worihip which is dcvifcd by men. Mat. i5.9.Cfl/.;.25.

24. The fin which if committed in will-worfhip, is by a i;encra}i name called fuperftition*

25. Superftition is that whereby undue worship is yielded to God.

2 5. For in fupcrftition God is alwaycs thcob/cft, and the end in fome meaftire^ but the worfhip it ielfc is un-lawfulK

27* It is called undue werfhipjcither in rcfpeft of the manner or meafurcj or in refpeft ofthe matter and fnbftance of the worfhip. In the former manner the Pharifes oflFendcd a-bone the Sabboth , when they urged the oblcrvation ofijt as touching the outward reft 5 above the manner and mea*

;/urc appointed by God. And they alfo offended in the lattcj?

.Qianner, in obferving and urging their owne traditions^

2.8. Hence fupcrftition is called an cxceflc of religion, not in refpeft of the formall power of religion, becaulcio ^Bonecan be too religious ; butinrefpe&unto thcaftsand roeanes of religion.

29. This exccffc is not only in thofe pofitive excrcifes, which confifts in the ufe of things, but alfo in abftinence from theufeof fbmethings,as from meats, which are accounted uncleane aTid nnlawfull^and the like.

3a Yet every abftinencc,even from things la wfull, although they be counted unlawfull, is not fupcrftition,to fpeake pro^

perly,



ptrly, unlcflethert befomefpcciall worftiipand Ucrnoar in-tended to God by that abftinencc.

51. This nnduc worflaip is cither properly oppofed ta that worftiip 3 wherein inftitutcd worfhip is direftly put forth and cxcrcifed, that is^ in hearing the word,celebration of the Sacraments, and prayer; or to that which rcfpefts the meanes of it.

32, Unto the hearing of the word is oppofcd, firft, A teachingby images deviled by xtxth.Dem.^.i 5jii. If^^oA I* 8c 41. 29, Jercm. lo. 8m5. Hek2^i%. Secondly, avanting of traditions as they arc propounded as rules ot religion, Mac.j. 8. '

33. Religious teaching by Images is condemned^irft^be^ caufe they ar« n6t fanftified by God tothatend :fccondly> becaufe they can neither reprefeat to usGod hiffifelfc,northe perfcftions of God ; thirdly, becaufe they debate the fbulC|l and turne away the attention frooi (piricuall contemplation of the Will of God ; fourthly, becauft if they bconcead:* mittcd into the cxercifcs of worfhip, the woirQjip it (clfe bythepcrverfnefreofmans wit, atleafl, in part, will be transferred to them : as it is declared in thofe words of ihc Coramandement. Thou (halt notbowdownetotheiOjnor worfhip them.

^4» Of like kind withimagcs;, are allthc^e.ceremonies, which are ordaicied by men for myfticall or religious (ig-nification. r..

35. For fuch ceremonies have no determinate power t^ teachv^^ither by any power put into theaiBy^iatiirc , or bjr^^^ divine inftitotian : but they can receive none by humane inr '^ ftitutio^j becaufe man can effeft this neither by commanding 5 feeing it is beyond his authority , nor by obtai-ning,fceing God hath proEiifed no fuch thing to him that asketh. irjlo^sn /

.' - 5^. Neither can men take to themielves any authority in ordainingluch ceremonies,from that, that it iscomman-ded to all Churches, that all things be done decently, and in order- i ^^r.i^.^o.For neither the refpei^ of order nor decency requires, that fomc holy things(hould be newly ordained, but that thofe which are ordained by God , be

ufed



Ofinjlitutedw^tfi^ip.

iifcdinthat manner, which is agreeable to their dignityj neither doe order and decency pertrine to holy things only, but alfo to civil! duties 5 for conftifion and indecency in boih are vices oppofite to that due manner which is required to the attaining the juft end and ufe of them*

37. TotheSacramcntsareoppofcd. i. Sacrifices properly to called,whether they be bloudy or unbloudy, as the Papifts faigne of their Made : for alter Chrift exhibited^aH old facrificcs arc abrogated: neither is th^re any new ordinance, becaufe the (acrifice of Chrift being once offered we have no need of other types 5 then thofc which pertaine to the exhibition and ftaling of Chrift beftowed on us, which is fufficiently by Gods ordinance performed in ^he Sacraments^ (without Sacrifices.)

38. Alfo the ordination and ufe of new Icales, or ceremonies fealing fomc grace of God is oppofcd to the Sacraments : for it belongs to him to feale grace ^ to whom it belongs to give it.

39. Unto prayer is oppofed that relative u(e of Images, whereby God is worfliipped at them^or before them^although the worfhip is not referred to the Images thcrafelvcSj as fomc fay, fubjeftivclyi but objeftively by them to G od alone.

4a Superftition of thk kind is called idolatry. Sxodtu 3 2.

41. IftheybeidoUs, which are in themfelves worfliipped ilftead of God, it is that idolatry which is againft the grit

•^Commandement ; but when the true GoJ is worfliipped at '^^ an Imagcor in an Image, this is idolatryjWhich is againil the . fecond Commandement.

42. For although in refpeft of the intention of him that *yorfliippech, he doth not offend in the primary or higheft objeft , yet from the nature of the thing it lelfc healwayes offends againrtthe formall worfliip of God, andinterpre-tativeiyalfoanewGodisfaignedfoTtheobjeft, whois delighted with (iich wnrfliip, and religious worfliip is given alfo to the Image it felfe, although it be not done with that purpofe that that worfliip be laftly bounded in the Tmage,but that it be by that direfted alfo to God himfelfe.

Jfaj 1.15.^

7.That (utable manner if^when thofc circumftances are ufed which the nature of religious things requires.

8. We define this manner by circumftances* becaufe the edentiall manner of virtues, and of the a&s of religion is contained inthe virtues and afts themftlves, and is direftly commanded in the lame precepts with them ; but that acci-dentall manner which is in circumftances y feeing it is in fome fort ftparable from the afts of Religion , and yet is ne-ccflarily required to them, that they may be acceptable to Ood, is ina fpeciall laannercomnandedin this third Com* mandement.

^•Thefe circumftances are either inward or outward.

xo. The inward are either antecedent, or going before; concomitant or accompanying with ;x:on(cqucut5or following after*

Nn 2 li«The



11 • The circumftances going before are a delire 5 and ftir* ring up of the mind, or preparation in a due meditation of t'hcfc things which pcrtainc to that holy thing, which is to be handled.

13. Hence before publick and folemne hearing the word and prayer, private prayer is required, and alfo before private prayer, if it be folemne, there is required fome meditation alfo of tholtf things which pertaine to our prayers, whether in rcfpeft of God whom we pray unto, or in refpeft of our felves who are about to pray, OP in refpeft of the things themfelvcs whicharetobeasked^ ' "^ u;i4.

17. Devotion alfo contaiaes two things, 1. A certaine fingular readinefle to performe all thofe things which pertaine to the worftiip of God, Pfal. 108.25. O God^ I will -iing with a fxed heart. I will awake right early. 2. A fiitable delight in perforraingthofcDhlngs.//^58.l3. If thoufhalt call the Sabbath a delight.

18. Hence alfo a greater care and of another kind muft be

had



had in hearing the Word of God^thcn in receiving the Edicts of Princes ; And in calling upon the Name of God then in fupplic-itior.Sj which we make to men whomioevc^.

I p. The circuinitances that follow after are two. i. To retaine the force and taft as it werc^of that worfhipin our mindb\ 2. ToobtairjC with all our endeavour the end ^ and ufe of it,

2C* The outward circumfiances arc thofe which percainc toorder and decency, i Cor.i^.^o. Let all things be done decently and in order.

21. But the generallrule of thefeis, that they be ordered in that manner which maketh moft for ediiication. i.

22. Of this nature are the circumft^nces of place, time, and the like 3 which arc common adjunfts of religious and civill afts.

^7* Therefore although fuch like circumftances arc wont to be called of £ome rites ^ and religious or Ecclelafticall ceremonies: Yet they have nothing in their nature, v/hichis proper to religion , and therefore religious worfliip doth not fo properly confift in them , however the hoiineffe of religious worfhip is in.fomc fort violated by the ncglcft^and contempt of them ; bccaufe that common refpeft of order and decency which doth equally agree to religious , and civill a<5lion? cannot be fevered fnm religious worfhip, but the dignity and majefty thereof is in fome fort diminifhed.

24. Such like circumftances therefore which of their own ' nature arc civill or common, are not particularly commanded in the Scriptures, parriy becaufe they come into mens common fence, and partly becaule it would not rtand with the dignity and majcfty of the Law of God, that fuch things (houJd be Severally prefcnbed in it. For by this meanes many ridiculous things fliould have been provided for by a fpcciallLaW;^ as for example^thac in the Church aiJcmbly one fhould not place himfclfe in anothers bolbmc, fpit in anothers face, or fliould not make mouthes in holy aftion?. Yet they ars to be accounted as commanded from Cod* I. Becaufe they are commanded in generall under the Law of order^ decency and edification. 2« Becatale moft of theoa

Nn 3 djc



doe neceflarily follow from thofe things wbich arc exprcfly appointed by God. For when God appointed that the faith-full of aU forts, fhould meet together to celebrate hisnam^ and woiftiip, he did consequently ordaine that they fhould haveafit^and convenient place wherein they may meetetoge-ther, and an hour^e alfoaffigncd at which they may bepreftnt together; when alfo there is a Minifter ?<ppointed by Godj to teach others publickly, it is withall appointed that he have a feat-and thatfituation of his body , which is meet for fuch an aflion.

25, Thoft things therefore which pcrtainc to order and decency, are not fo left to mens wil, that they may under the name of that, obtrude what they pleafc upon the Churches: but rhey arc* partly determined by the gencrall precepts of God, partly by the nature of the things themfelvcs, and partly by tho(e circumftanccs which doe offer tbcmfdves upon occafiom

26. For divers circumftanccs of order and decency arc fuchjas though there be no publick inftitution ofthcm,yet they ought to be obferved of every one, neither can men forbid them without fin.

2 7. But thofe conftitutions by which many circumftanccs of this kind arc wont to be determined, about.placc, time and the like, are rightly faid to be by the beft Divines partly Divine, and partly humane : becaufe they are partly grounded upon the Will of God, in rcfpcft of the chicfc and primary reafon of them 9 and they depend partly upon the prudence of men, in refpeft of particular ob(crvation^' of thofe things which are agreeable to the Will of God : yet fo that if there be no error of man in making that dc-terminationjthat conftitmionis to be held as fimply Divine. For it is the Will of God^that the Church meet at that hourc of the day, whichf all circamftances confidered)is moft con- ' venicnr. If therefore there be no error inobfervationof the circumftances,thathoure which by their due confidcration is affigned for meeting 5 muft be acknowledged as if it were appointed by God.

28.The fpeciall manner ofthc worftiip of God muft be fpc-cially determined, as the fpeciall nature of every religious a<Sion doth require. 29.Hitherto

of the time ofworfidp*

Chapter XV^

Of the time ofworjhif.

i.f I ' H E moftfokmnc time of worfhip is now the I firft day of every week which is called the Lords day,

t. And it is called the Lords Day, by the fame reafon that the holy Supper of the EuGharift is called the Lords Supper. I ^or.ii.20. Namely becaiifc it wasi inftituted by our Lord JefusChrift, and it mirilbe referred to the fame Lord in the end and ufe of it.

3. It is neceflary that (brae time be given tor the worftiip of God, by the diftate of naturall realbn: for man rauft needs have time for alJj efpecially his outward actions; neither can he conveniently attend Divine worftiip, unleflfe for that time he ccale from other workes.

4. Thus far therefore the time of worftiip falls upon the fame precept with the worftiip it fclfe ; for as when God created che whole world, he is faid alfo to have created time together with it; fo alio when he commanded, and ordained religious aftionSj he did alfo withal command and ordaine fometime or neceffary circumftance.

5. That fome certaine day is to be ordained for the more folemne worftiip of Godj this is alfo of morall naturall right, ^* not unknownc to the very hcathen^who had alwayes through alages ; their fet and folemne fcaft dayes,

6. Ihatthisfolemneday oughttobeoneatleaftinawcek or in the compafle of (even 5 this belongs to pofitive Law, but yet \i is altogether of unchangable inftitution ; fo that in ' refpeft of our duty and obligation it hath the very fame force and reafon with thofetbatare of morall and naturall right, and fo it is rightly (aid of the Schoolmen, to belong to moral right;not of nature^but ot Difcipliiie.

y.That this inftitution was not ccren:;onia)Land temporal!; it appeares fufficiently by this ^ that it hath nothing proper

to



to the Jey^es^ or to the time of the cercmoniall Law 5 for none carij or dare deny, but that ftich determination might be made,at leaft for a morall reafon and benefit,becaufe although fiaturall rcafon doth not diftatc the very (ame determination as neceflary 5 yet it dilates it as con?enient5 as it doth apprehend it to b€ fit that the worfliip of God be frequently cxercifed , and it cannot but acknowledge this determination ia refpeft of the frequency of the dayes to be in ckis ttfytdi convcnientt

%. The fame alfo is manifeft by this that from the begia* ning of the Creation, when there was no place for ceremonies that had rcfpeft to Chrift the Redeemer the feventh dayi or one of (even was fct apar» for the wor&ip of Godt

9. For whereas fome dot cantendj that this was fpoken by aprokpfis or anticipation ; of that the feventh day was at that time (anftified in the mind and purpofi of 'God, not in execution: or that then there was a foundation laid of that; fan^ification to come 5 and not the obligation or Law it felfe. This may be refuted by divers arguments. Fori. This anticipation never came into any mans mind who was not before anticipated with prejudice about the bbfcrvatioa of the Lords Day. Ih^Iewes of old didneverdreameof it; whofe received opinion ws«, that this feaft was '^'f^P^/^or, xc^ rS >co(rp yimi^v among all Nations from the beginning of the World. Philo m^iv^o^ix.^. 14, la the newTeftameaC there is >nofuch thing taught or declared. The authors themlclves of this opinion doe grant it to be probable,that fome obferva-tion of the ftv^enth day, did begin from the beginning of the Creation. Suar z, ic dichHs Fell. The beil interpreters (Lu^ theryC^tvin^ &c. ) Whom none will affirme to have ofFcaded • on that fide in giving too much to the Lords Day, doe £mply, and candidly acknowledgc,that the feventh day was fanftificd from the beginning of the World. 2. There can* be no example given of (iich like anticipation in all the Scrip-tare: for although the name of certaine places are fometime fifed, prolepticalIy,erpecially in the booke of Genefis^ yet there is no mention at all of fuch a prolcpticall Inftitution, cither in that bookc, or in any other of the whole facred

The words and phrafcs of the very pUcc cviact thccoiitrary.(7^»,a.i^3,Forthe pcifcdion of theGrcatioais twice joyncd together with the fanftification of the fcventh day m the very faoic manner and phrafc, as the Creation both ofothcr Creatures and-ef man himfelfc, IS jjyned with theirbleffing. Genefis 1.21.22.27,28. 4.Neitherthcpiirpofe of Godj nor a naked foundation of the thing it felfe fufficcth^ to ground and uphold fuch a phrafe of Sandiification and Benedi(5tion. Forby thisrcafon it might be faid^that God fanftified Water, Bread and Wine for the Sacraments ofithc New Covenant^ from the time that he gave the promife of breaking the Serpents head by the feed of the woman, Genefis 5.15. For then God did purpofe to feale that covenant of grace by fuch fcales, (bme foundation of which feales alfo was laid partly in the promife it felft, and partly in the creation ofthofe thin-gs whichmight aftually be ufed to fuch fealing. 5. From fuch a foundation laid in the firft Crearion, the Prophet gathers a perpetuall rule and Law* Malac*2.'t^. Did he not make one ? and why one I To fceke a godly feed. So in like manner may we : did not God rcit the fcvenih day > and why the feventh day V to fanftifie the feventh day to God. 6. Upon this very thing the arguing of the Apoftle feemes to begrounded, Hebrews 4 3543 5,7^ 8,9. Which is thus. There was a double reft mentioned in the Old Tcfta* inentj whereof the godly were made partakers in this lifca One was of the Sabbath ^ and the other was of the Land of Canaan : but David Ffalme py. promiiTHig reftg fpeaketh^* not of the reft of the Sabbath, becau(e that was from the beginning of the World; nor of the reft in the Land of C/t-naan^ becaufe that was paftgUOt to be expected. To day therefore be underftands a certaine third reft 3 that is, eternallin Heaven.

10. Neither doth it any thing hinder this truth 5 that it is not recorded in the Hiftory of Genefts , that the obfervati-on of the feventh day was folemny kept by the firft F^^ri-^rchf. For i# All and every thing which was obftrved by them for a thoufand and five hundred yeares, neither could nor ought to be particularly declared in fo fiiort a Hiftory ^s is that oi Gf^ejjf. Alfo after ihe Law oft he Sabbath de-

liyercd by Mofes , there is no mention in the bookc of Indies and feme other Hiftories, of the cbfervation of it. 2. If this very thing be granted that the obfervationofthisday was for the moft part neglcc'led, yet this ought no more to make the firft inftitution doubtful! , then Polygamy of the fame times can (hew that the facred Lawes of Wedlock were not cqHall in time with the very firft mariage. 3. Before the promulgation of the Law in Mount Shai ^ the obfervation of the Law is propounded and urged.not as a new thing, but ordainedofold. £a;^^^ itf.24.30. Which although it may be affirmed of (acrifices and fome other ceremoniall obfer-vations» yet in the Sabbath, there (eemes to be for the realbns before put , a certaine refped: had unto the firft inftitution, which was equal] in time with mans Creation, which is alfo declared in the )^o^^.

II. But the right , and morall perpetuall authority of thisiniUtution is moft of all declared from this^ that it is ex-prcfly commanded in the Decalogue ^ for this is a nK)ftcer-tainerule, and received among all the beft Divines 5 That uiorall precepts were thus differenced from ceremonialls aad ludicialls, that all and onely moralls were publickly proclaimed before all the people o(Ifrael (torn Mcunt*yiW ^ by the voyce of God himfelfe^andafterward alfowritten, and written againe as it were by the finger of God himftlfej and that in Tables of ftoncj to declare their perpctuall and unchangeable continuance; Chrift alfo doth exprefly tcftific that not one Jot 5 or tittle ©f this Law fliould perifta Matthiw ^a^.

12. That which is commanded in the fourth Commandc-©lent, is not indeed of a morall nature in the fame degree and manner altogether with thoft things that are com^E^a^ded5 for themoft part in all the other Commandcment^ ; becaufe it belongs to pofitive right, whence alfo it is, that where-* as the three former Commandenients were propounded ne* gatively, by forbidding thofe vices unto which we are pronfr by tlTc pravity of our nature^ this fourth Coi»maRdcmenc isfirft propounded affirmatively in declaring, andcomsna^-dingthat which in this part pertaines unto our duty, ani? afterward Rcgatively, by forbidding thofe things which are repugnant to this duty 5 which al(b is in part thereafoti of that admonition which is fpecially prefixed before this precept, remember the Sabbath day, that is, remember ta keepcthisday,a8 it is explained, Z)^/^^5.i8. Because it may more eafily be forgotten, feeing it belongs topofitiverightj then many other things which are more natural!* Yet this pofitive right upon which this ordinance is grounded , is Divine right^ and in refpeft of man altogether unchanged able.

13. Thofe who turne this fourth Commandemcnt into al-legQues of a eeffaUon from finnes, and frp^n the troubles of

14. But thofe that would have this precept cercmoniall (asthcy would hav^ the (econd to be alio) bendes that they are fuffictently refuted, by thole things which have becae fpoken before, they contradift the expreffe teAiinony of ScripLure,which affirmes that ten words , or morall precepts are contained in the decaIogue,£^(?^.34.i 8.'Z)c'^r,4.13. & 10. 4. Where they leave only nine, or rather eight.

15. The J who would have that only to be morall in thi,s precept^ thatfome time, or feme ccrtaine daycs ^ fhouldbe affigned to Divine worfliip, doe no more mate this ordinance to be morall, then was the building of the Tabernacle and Temple amoag the levpes. For by that very thing this was dechred to all t<^ be the perp^tuall Will of Ood, that fome fie placeisalwayesto be appointed for Church meetings, and publick cxercifcs of Divine worfhip : fo that by this reafon, there is no more a morall precept givea touching fom? time ofwor&ipjthen there isgiven touching the place^and To neither that indeed (which only they leave in the fourth precept,) Thou (halt observe Feaft-dayes, ought any more to be put in the Decalogue thea this, Thou (halt frequent the J Temples

i5» Moreover^the ycarely FeaSs,new Mooncs^and the like ordinances, which were mecrcly cercmoniall doecontaine that gencrall equity alio in them 5 and doe ftill teach us that fome certaine and fit dayes ought to be appointed for pub" lick worfhipriinallyjby thisicaron God fhould by this Com-mandement command (cverall men , nothing at .all: for feeing the inftitution of dayes by this opinion is only commanded immediatly, and it is not in the power of private men to ordainethefe or thofe dayes for publick worlhip, by this meanes nothing at all fhoald be commanded but at their will who are in publick office.: neither {hould any thing be commaadcd themjn rpeciallj but only in g^nerall-^ t;hat they

Oo 3 doe j



of the time ofDivme wor/fjipl doe according to their vvifdome in fefcUng apart daycg to publicke worfhip, fo that if it feeme good to them to appoint one day of twenty or thirty to this ufe, they cannot be reproved of any fin in thisrclipeftj as if they broke this Com-mandement.

17. If there were ever any thing ccremoniall in the Sabbath in refpeft of the very obfervation of the day 5 that is to be accounted for a thing added to it^ or a conftitution com-ming extrinfecally 5 beyond the nature of the Sabbath ^ and the nrft inftitation of it ^ and fo it nothing hinders but the inftitution of the ftventh day was fimply morall: for fo there was a cercmoniall refpcft of fomc type added to fomc other Commandenients 3 as in the authority of Fathers, and the firft borne of Familics,which pertaine to the firft Coramandc-mentj there was a certaine adumbration of Chrift, who is the firft begotten among the Sons of God.

18. Neither yet doth it certainly appcare in the Scriptures, that there was any ceremony properly fo called, or type, in the obfervation of the fcventh day : forwhereas, Het.^.^ there is mention made of a fpirituall Sabbatifmc, prefigured before by a type, it is under the refpeft of a type referred only to the reft prpmifed in the Land of Canaan^ and by com* parifbn of things like, to the reft of God ; but in no fort, or in the leaft fignification is it referred to the reft commanded in the fourth Commandement 3 as unto a type or fhaddow.

19. But whereas in £W*ji.13.17. Knd E^ch.io, 2€m The Sabbath is called afignc betweencGod and his people^ it cannot thence be made a type or reprefentation of any future grace : Becaufe i. A fignc doth often note the fame that an argument, or inftru^ion, as alfo the moft learned interpreters doe note upon Exodns^x. It isafignebctwcen me, &c. thatis^aninttruftion. Soourmutuallloveisafignc that we are the Difciplcs of Chrift. lohni^.^^. Butitisnot a type* 2. The Sabbath in thofc places is not faid to be a fignc of feme thing to come, but prefent, as every vifiblc concomitant adjunft is a ligne of the (ubjcft being pr^nt. For in the obftrvation of the Sabbath thcreis acommon^and publike profcffion of that coEnmuaion wbkh is between God

and



of the time of Divine worfijip. m ^

ftnd u$:as therefore al folemn prcfeflTion is aligne of that thing U'hercof it is a profeffion, fo alfo the Sabbath is in that common refpefl called a fignc.

to. And this is the mod proper reafon, why the obftr-vationoftheS-ibbathisfomuch urgedj and the breaking of it To ftverely punilhcd in the old Teftament: namely becauft there was in the Sabbath a common andpublikc profcffion of all Religion; for this Gommandementasitis aclofeofthe firft Tible of the Law,doth thus fummarily conraine the whole worfhipofGod, whileft it commands a ccrtaine day for all the cxercifcs thereof. EyQj' 5^.2.

21. There were many ceremoaies ordained about the ob-fcrvation of the Sabbath : but the obftrvation of the Sabbath was no more made ccremoniall by them, then ic was judicial! or politicalljbecaufe of thoft jiadiciali LaweSj whereby it was then provided that it flbould be celebrated moft religi-

2 2.That accommodation of the fourth Commandcment untothefpeciall ftateofthe/^75^^/i which was ia theobler-vation of the fevcnth day from the beginning of the Creation, doth no more make the precept it lelfe cercmoniall^then the promife of the Land oi Canaan , made to the people of Ifrael^ That thou mayft live long in the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee 5 makes the fift Gommanderaent cere-moniall : or more then that Preface, I am the Lord thy God which brought thee out of the Land of Efjft^ makes all the Commandementsceremoniall. ^

23* It may indeed be granted that a more ftrift obfervation of the Sabbath was commanded in thole day es5 applied to the Xim^ of Pedagogy and bondage, which is not of force in all g^ges 5 yet this hinders not but the oblervation it felfe is plainly morall and common to all ages*

24. Yet there can be nothing brought o^it of the Scriptures, which was at any time commanded about the ftrift obfcrvation of the Sabbath to the Jewes / which by the fame reafon doth not pertains to all Ghriftians, except the kindling of fires , and preparing their ordinary food. Ex9d,^'^t 5.& 16.14. And thole precepts feeme to have been (peciall, and given uDon partiwlac occ^lion 5 for there is noting

laid



faid about the kindling of fire, but in the building of the Tabernacle 3 which God would declare was boc fo holy a workcbutit might and ought to be intermitted on the Sabbath day. Neither is there any mention of the preparing of viftualls, but when manna was by a miracle fent from Heaven ^ which ivas alfo by a aiiracle prelerved on the Sabbath day. And by the Hiftory of Chrift it appcares very likely that he did approve of preparing viftualls,donc by kindling of a fire, upon the Sabbath day. For being invited by the lewes to a feaft which was had on the Sabbath day, be refu(ed not to be prcCcnt.Luc. i^.i.Scc.

2 $• Whereas the reafon of the Sabbath doth fomctimefeem to be referred to the delivering of the people of Ifyael out of the captivity oi Egypt ^ it doth not turnethe Sabbath into a ceremony. For i. AH the Commandements are in fome fortreferredco the fame deliverance, as appeares by the Preface of the decalogue. 2. It doth not appeare that the Sabbath it felfe had any Angular relarion to this deliverance, but that there is mention made of the deliverance out of Bgjft^ Deut.').i'y. For that reafon onely 5 that feeing the JfrAelites had been fcrvante before mSgyft^ they ought the laore readily and willingly grant this time of reft* to their fervants.

26. Whereas the laft day of the wccke was of old obftrved, this wasanciently ordained by Gcd from the timeofthefirft Greation^becaufe God did that day ceaie from the workes of Creation. ' r

27. Whereas the laft day of the weebe is now changed into the firft day, this was not done by humane, but Divine authority. For he only can change the day of the Sabbath, who is Lord of the Sabbath, that is, Chrift. Marc^ 12. 8. Whence alfo.that firft day which (uccecded^is properly called the Lords Day.

28. If this Lords Day be granted to have been of apofto-Kcallinftitution, yet that authority which it is built upon, is nevcrthelefle divine j becaufe the Apoftles were no Ic^ f uided by the fpirit in holy itaftitutionSj then in propounding file doAririe of the Gofpell, either in word or Writing?*

^^t Alfa(eeing this infiitmion was grounded upon rio (pedal



ciall occafion that was to continue for a time only, whereby it migfat be made temporary, it doth neccfla'^ily toUoWj thac the minde of the Ordainers was, that the oblervacioii of thii day (houtd be of perpetual! and unchangeable right,

For the TuWifh Sabbath was in refpeft ofthe determination which it had to the levcnth day abrogate in <\\t death of Chrift : For whereas it is read chat the Apoftles fometimc after were prefent in the affemblies oftheJewes th.it diy of theSabbath, Ahhx^.i^ic 16.13.& 17.2.& i8.4.they did that chiefly in that rcfpcft becaufe chen was the fitteft occa(ion to preach the Gorpell to the Jewes; as alfo afterward the Apoftle did greatly defirc to be ac Jerusalem on the d^y of Pencecoftjt^^/ 20.16. becaufe at that time there was the greateftconcourfe of the Jewes to be in that place. 7.

They among themfelves who account the Lords day among traditions doe account baptizing of children alfo and that with greater (hew in the ftme place and number. But all our DivineSj who have anfwered the Papifts touching thofe examples of traditions, do alwaycs contend that thofe inftitutions and all other which are of the fame profit and neccflity , are to be found in the Scriptures thcm-iclvcs.

3s. Thofe things which arc wont to be brought on the contrary out of tke Scriptures, Rom»ii\,.'^, Gal,^.\o. CgL2.i6. do nothing at all hinder this truth. For firft, in all thole places the obfervation of fomc day to religious u(e by the ordinance of Chrift^ is no more condemned or denied, then the choife ot fomc certaine meat to a religious ufe by the ordinance of the fame Chrift: but no Chriftian is fo void of all rcafon, that he would conclude but of thofe places, that the choife of bread and wine in the LordsSupper for a religious uft, is either unlawfullj or not ordained by Chrift: neither therefore can any thing be concluded from them againft the obfervation of the Lords day by the ufeandinftitutionof Chrift. Secondly, the Apoftle Rom. 1 4. doth exprcfly fpeakc of that eftimation of dayes, which did at that time breed offence among Chriftians; but the obfervation of the Lords day w^ the Apoftle himfelf teacheth, had at that time taken place , in all tbe Churches, 1 C^r.i6,i. & 2. could not giveany occa-' fionx)f offence. Thirdly, it is moft like that the Apoftle in that I place doth treat of chafing of dayes to eat or refufe certaine] meats; for the qucftion of that difpute is propounded verfe 2.

P 2 of



of meats only: in the 5. and 6. vcrfts, the eftecme of a duty is joy ned with ic as pertaining to the fame thing, and afterward through all the red of the Chapter he treats only of meatSjina-king no mention of dayes. Fourcbly^ in that place to the C?^-latians, it is exprcfly treated of that obftrvati ^n of daycSj mo-neths, and yeares, which pertained to the bondage of weake and beggerly elements,Chap«4.9. but it was farrefrom the ApoHie, and altogether ftrangetoChriftian religion fo to account any precept of the Decalogue, or any ordinance of Chrift. Fifthly, in C^l* 2. it is fpecially and exprefly treated of thofe Sabbaths which were of the famekindewich new MooneSj and were ceremoniali (badowes of things to come in Chrift : but the Sabbath commanded in the Decalogue and our Lords day arc altogether of another nature, as^ bath been before demonftrated.

33. Neither is Chriftian liberty at alldiminifhedbythis opinionj (as fome without caufe do (eemetofearej foritis not a liberty, but a licentioufnefle not Chriftian, if any think themfelves freed from the obfervation of any precept of the Decalogue, or from the inftitutions of Chrift: and experience alibteachcth that licentioufnefle, and negled: of holy things doth more and more prevaile,where a due refpcft is not had of the Lords day.

34. Neicher aifo was A^dm{{\h]t^ to any bofidagc^becaufc be was tyed to fandifie the feventfa day by a fpeciali obfervation.

35, But as the beginning of fhe old Sabbath was at t^e fvening; becaufe the Creation alfo began at the evening, be* . caufc the common mafle was created before the light, and the reflation of the day from the work of Creation began alfo at the evening ; fo alfo the beginning of chc Lords day doth fceme to begin from the morning of that day, becaufe the re farredion of Chrift was betimes in the morning, Mark^i6.9:

36a For the right obfervation of this day two things arc-^ neccfiiryj reft, and the fanftification of this reft.

37. The reft which is required is a cefl^^tion from every worke which might hinder the excrcifts of Divine worfeip:. ,we muft therefore abftaine that day. i • From all thofe works

which



lUfhich are prapcrly called lervile; for feeing fuch Works we^c of old by namecxcludcd^in all other folcmnc \tz&%^Levit.2^. 7.8,25 32.36,A^/i^^. 28.15. much more were they excluded from the Sabbath.

38. But itisridiculuusby (ervile worke&toiinderftandfiiis or mercenary good workcs^ or done (after the manner of fer-vantsj for reward (as fomcdoiindtrlland them by a certihie Allegoricall fport:) for fins are not forbidden and unlawfull at fomecertaiaetimes, but ahvayes and every where : neither doth it pertain to the fourth CommanJcment to deal with all finnes to be forbidden 5 although this may in fome ftnce be granted that divers (innes doc take fome aggravation from thence if they be committed upon (b holy a day, T;^^; 58.4. tbofc evill workes alio which are done iipon feare or hepe, that is, altogether fervilc, have in rclpcfl: of their manner the fame i.ature with other linj.

39. But fervilc workes are properly thofe, to the performance whereof fcivants or fervile men are wonttobeufed, fuch as arc mechanick workes, and all thoie to the performance whereof great labour ot the body is required, as to plough, to dig, &c. 2. Befides thcfe worker there are forbidden alfo upon that day all workes that arc ours: as is gathered from the oppofite conceffion which is given in the fourth precept. Six dayes (halt thou worke and doall thy work.

40. Whence we may gather with the words tollowing, on the Sabbath day thou (halt doe no worke : that all tha(c

I works are forbidden which are propedy called ours^although they be not to fpeak ftriftly, fervile, or mechanicall.

41. Now thofe arc our workes which pcrtaiwe to the u(es ofthislife^ thatisj which areexercifed in naturall and civill things, and do properly pertaine to air gaine and profit: of which kinde are thofe which cf their owne nature arc not (ervile but liberall 5 asftudyingSj cxercifesofliberallarts'^ much more tiiofe which are common to iit^ men and (ervant^j as to jorney, to handle civill eaules, &c.

42. For i'o this phrafe is explained, Ef^j'yZ^y Ye do that , which delighteth you^that ye may exa^fl all your Iabours,that is^ycdo carefully your owne matters, Verfc 13. doing thine owne wayes. Bjt becaufc £/^j.^^ in that Chapter doth alfo

and



of the time of Divine Vfiorjhip^

and chiefly treat of wicked aftions ^ and thofc workcs which arc unUwfull at all times, asappearethverfe^, Therefore fome godly Divines do feerac to crre, who arc wont to gather out oUhat place, that every word or thought that is hu nane, or pcrtaincs to mcn^ufed on the Lords day, is to be accounted fihne. for all humane words, deeds, or thoughts upon that day, whereof that Chapter handleth, (^whether it be the Sabbath properly called, or a folemnc feaft) arc not there judged to be impertinent, and in that rcfpeft limply reprehended; but thofe only which are wont to concerne our gaiae, either fimply unlawfull or repugnant to holy exercifeSj as appcarcs verfe 3.& 6* Concerning iiich (ervilc and vulgar workcs there is fuch a drift law, that upon the Sabbath day men may not go on in their work, no not in time of plowing and harvcft {imply ; that is, at thofe, times which aremoft opportune and as it were ncccffary for mans life, f'W.34.ii, Norintbofe things which doe mediately and remotely pcrtainc to holy things, as was the building of the Tabcrnaclc^flv^i/.jr. 15. Much lefle is it lawfaU to enter into any ordinary journey, Exod. 1 6. or to frequent Marts or Faires, Nehem, i j.

43. Yet here arc excepted; i« All thofe workes which belong to common honefty: for feeing at all other times wc ought, fo cfpecially upon that day which is fpccially dedicated to Divine worfttip, to behave and carry our fclves decent-ly : all thdfe things which doe iimplypertainc thereunto arc undcrftcod to be permitted. 2. Thofe things which are im-j^fed on us by fome lingular neceflity. Mat. 12.11. In which number notwithftanding thofe things arcnottobeaccoun* tedj which men make or fainc to themfelves as neceflary: but thofe things which it appcarcs to be neceflary and unavoidable, by the providence of God, and which wc arc not aware of, that is, when fuch a nccelfity urgeth as the Scripture it felf allowcs as a fiifficrcnt caufe to do any ordinary thing. 7. All thofe works which do direftly refpeft the worfliip and glory ofGod,J<f^r.i2.5, Ma? 5^.839. For in that cafe thofe workes whichareofthcirowncna'urefervilcj do paflc into the nature of holy aftions, neither are they properly cur workes, but Gods works.

44 This reft, although in it fclfc abfolutely confidcred, it



h not, reither ever was a part of worftiip; yetas it is coniimn-ded oiGoJasacertaineneccflaiy thing unto his worfhip,||nd isrcterrcd alfo to it, fo far it is a part ot that obedience whith pertciines to religion and the worfhip of God.

45. The fanftification of this reft and day is a fpeciall applying of our feives to worfhip God3Upon that day which is intimated in tho(ephra(e«5 He raniSihed that day ^ and it is a Sabbath to the Lord thy God.

46- Here publick ivorfhip ought chiefly to be rcfpcitedj whence alfo it is that the Sabbath is called an holy Convoca-tion, Zf^/V. 23 13, «x^ff/13.14. & 15.23 & 16.13. But that that publick convocation of the Church ought to be had both before and <ifter noone upon the Loi^s day, it appeares fuffi-ciencly, by that double burnt offeringof the Sabbath, in the morning and the evening, iV//w.28,^.

47. But the reft of the day ought to be fpent in excrcifes of piety : for although there was of old an offering peculiar to the Sabbath 5 yetthe continuall or daily offering with his drink offering was not to be omitted^ A^//^.28.io. • '

48. Alfo the publick worQiip it (elfe feeing it is mod (b* lemnely to be ceiebratcdj doth neceflarily require thcie excr-dies of reading the Scripture, meditationj prayer, h^ly conferences aiiti contemplation of the workes of God : whereby we rany be both nioreprepared to publick worfhip^ and that worfhip may be made truly effeduall to us.

49. Contrary to this ordinance of the Lords day are all feaftdayes,ordained by men, they being accounted for holy dayeSj as the Lords day ought to be accounted.

50. For it is moft agreeable with f hefirftinftitution, and with the writings of the Apoftles, that onconly day in the Week be (anftified.

51* Thejcwcs had no feaft dayes rightly fanftified^but by divine inftitution.

5 2 • Yet any dayes may be pioufly turned into occafions of furthering the worftip of God,

53. Alfo when God by his fpeciall judgements cals to morelolernnefaft'ng^ thoft dayeS arc to be accounted as it were fpr extraordinary Sabbaths.

54. Contrary



54t Contrary alfo to the obfcrvation of this day and all

traiila^ftionsotbuiincflrc, cxcrcUcs^fcattings, fports, andfuch like, whereby the mindc of man is this day drawn away from thcexercifes of religion.

Chapter XVI.

of Infliceand ^aritjf toward our neighbour.

Thus much of Religion: Ju^icefoHowes^ which is contained in the Second 'tahlc

I. TT Ufticc is a veraic whereby we arc inclined to pcrforme I our duty due to our neighbour. So the duty ofchil-JL drcn towards their parents is faid to be juft, Ephsf6.i. And the duty ot matters towards their fervants is called right andequall, O/.4.1. And all thole things which we owe to our neighbour, are performed in living jultly.

2* But juftice in this place is wot taken moft generally, as (etting forth every duty to another: for Co it containes even religion it (elfe: for that juftice which is faid to be gencralJ, is no other thing then vertuc in gcnerall; as hath been before declared; when we did fticw that juftice was the chiefe a-^ mong the generallaffeSions of vertuc : neither muftitbeun-derftcod moft particularly to relpeft the quantity either of the thing deftrved or received, for lb it containes only a few duties of the fccond table^namelythofe whereby like is returned for like:but it is hercufed in a certaine middle way,wher-by it fets forth the mutual! duty between thofe who are bound by the (ame right; in which fence it containes all the force of the fccond lablc.

3. It hath for the objeft our neighbour, that iSj every one whether man or Angeli alfo, who is or may be with us per* taker of the fame end and bleflednefic, Lhk£ 1 0.3^,57.

4. Hence neither holy men, whatfoever they (hall be, nor Angels themfclves c-jin be a fit objcft of religion, or of that

religious



religious worftiip which is commanded in the firft Tabkj tKit only of Jiifticeorofthi^t.ducic that is due to our neighboijc which is contained in the fccond Table ; whence aUo thoCc argiinacnts taken from the natiiie of the thing, doe excUr.ic all adoration of the Crcaturer* Atl^ 10.26, Rife, for I my (elfe alfo am a man: Reve/.22,9» Seethou uoe it not, for I aai thy fellow fcrvanrjand of thy brethren the ProphetS;and of thole that kcepe the words of this Booke^ worfhip ,God. Rev.22» 9, ..? -

5. But in this number and name, every one is by proportion inclui ted even in refpect of him(elfe; for every oiie is firlt-a neighbour to himfelfejChen toothers- Whence aUoit is that tKere is no lingular precept given whereby a man may beor-dered toward himfelfe : for whileft he is rightly ordered toward God , and toward his neiahbour>he is^lfo ordered toward himftlfe; but with this diiference, that that difpofition whereby any is made fit to performe his duty to God and his neighbour 3 pertainesto hi3^perfc<rtion;but hemuHalfo pcrformethc fame duties both to his neighbour and himfelfe, (but not to God^and himlclfc,)

6. But becaufe that manner whereby duties are to be cx-prcifed toward our neighbour, is with reipcft and affedion to their good ^ hence this fame vertue is called charity toward ourneighbour.Af/ir.22.29.il/^rr« I2t3i.

7. In this charity there is alwaycs love qf union, of wel-plcafednefle and good will, as in that love which is toward Ood 5 but there is alfo added oft times the confideration of mcrcy^whenthemifcty of oar neighbour is refpefted^which bath no place iti our charity toward God.

8. But this band of Juftice and affeftion of Charity ought alwayes to flow , and be derived ftom Religion toward God ; for feeing Religion gives thediiefehonour to God, it caufeth that obedience be given to his will ihthofc things alfo which doe immediatly refpccfl the Creatures 5 whence all they who neglcft their duty towards men, are denied to honour God, but rather doe contemne him» i Sc4fp?,t.jo* Alfo charity towards God which is contained inRcligion, doth of its own nature produce charity towards men, as they arc in fomc fort partakers of the Image of God :

Q^q wheace



whence alfo we are faid to love God in men^ and men ia God, which is onercafon of that phrafe , beloved in the Lord,

9.Hcnce nothing is properly due to man which is contrary toKeligion. AEh /\ ig.&c ^.29. Whether it be right in the fight of God to obey you rather then God judge yce: we muft obey God rather then men.

10. Hence alfo the truthof Religion cannot confift with the negle«S of Juftice, and Charity toward ourneighbour. James i. 27* Religious worftiip^ pure and undefilcd before GodandthcFather, isthisj tovi(itthefatherleffe, andwid-dowes in affli<ftior. i hhn 4. 2G. 21. If any one fay I Jove Godj andhatehisbothcr,heisa Jyar. ThisCommandement have wee from God,that be that loveth God 3 love his brother alfo. ' II. Hence finally religion is beft proved, and tried by

Juftice, according to the frequent ufe of the Scripture, which argument notwichftanding doth (erue much more certainly for negation, then affirmationjf it be underftood of the outward workes and offices of Jufticc : becaufe fuch workes of |ufticc may be (bmetime prefent» where true religion is wanting; but it true religion be prefent, they cannot b« wholly abfent.

12. By thefamercafbn alfounjuft worfce$ doc more arguea man to be ungodi/jthen chofe which are juft doe argue a godly man:whence the workes of the flefli are faid to be manifeft. Gal.%.ig. Which is not affirmed of the fruits of. the(pirfc, Verfe 12.

13. The order of this charify is this, that God is firft and chiefly co be loved by charityjSnd To is as it were the formal! reafon of this charityrfoward our neighbour.ncxt after God Vtz are b >i;nd to love bur (elves, nimely with that charity which refpefts rruc blelfedneffe 5 for loving God himfclfc with love of union, we love our (elves immediatly with that chiefe ch trity which refpecls our fpirituail ble(l€dne(re : but wc/ ought to love others whom we would have partakers of the fiiiie good w'th us, fccondatily as it were; moreover others may Be deprived of this b!efrcdne(re without our fault, bat tve our ^elves cannot ;therc f/re we are m.orc bound to will and



of Iffjiice and charity to cur 'Neighbour. goi

14. Hence it is that the love of our felves haththcforceof a rule or meafure unto the love of others : Thou (halt love thy neighbour as thy felfe.

I").Hence it is never lawfull to commit any fin for anothers (akcj although our tffcnc- may (ecmc fmall , and to be.a chiefe good, which we (hould feckc to another : for he that wittingly and willingly finneth hateth his own foulc. Pro. 8.j6.& 29.-5^4% He that finneth againft me^ offererh violence to his own foule. He that partaketh with a thicfe^hateth him* fclfe, and he that hearing cuffing deciareth it not.

16. Among other men none indeed ought wholy to be rtmoved from the embracing of bur charity, who is capable df bleflrednefle j for if we love God above all things^no tamities will fo far prevaile with us^ bdt.we may love our v^ry enemies for God. LMHtk%*:^g.Rom.it.ij^ i Thejf.^.i^,

17. But among men thofe are more to be loved theno-therSj that comeneerer to God, and in God to our (elves. GaUtUns 6# I o. Let as doe good to allj but efpecially to the houlT'old of Faith.

J 8. But becaufe they that believe 5 are more neere both to God, and to us alfo fpiritually^ then thofe who doe not as yet believe ^ therefore alfo are they more to bee beloved.

19.Yet this is foto be underftood, that it be referred to the tune prefent and the immediat affeftion ; for we may will the fame good to fomc other as much or more in time to come, the grace of God and faith comming between 5 in which fence that afFeftion of the ApotHe concerning the Ifraeliuj is tobetaien.ff<?w.9.5.

20. If among thoic that are to be beloved there bd no apparent dil'parity neither in refpe^fl of God, nor in refpedl of USjthf n they are equally to be beloved.

21. But if any apparent difparityappeare 3 cither in their ncerencflc to God or to our (elves, then ha who exceeds in • any neercnefle^ is more to be beloved; that is, when we cannot exercifc the a9: of our love alike toward all, we are more bound to place our love on thofe whom God kath by (bmc fpeciall neerenefleor communion commended to us, then on

3^. To this praying is oppofed that innprecation which tends to the hurt of our neighbour ^ which is called curling*

35. Working of good toward our neighbour is an endeavour, concerning him> tending to his good ; whence alfo it is called a good deed. CMatthew 5. 44. And love in deed 1 fohn 3.18,

36. This working is diftinguilhed from praying; becaufe althoagh prayer be alio an endeavour tending to the good of our neighbour, yet it is not immediatly cxerciled about our neighbour, but it is dircftcd unto God.

37. Yet unto this working thofc endeavours niuft be referred which are ex«rciied about other Creatures for our neighbours fake; for then there h an efficiency in our aftions of the fame reafon, as if it were exercifcd immediatly about our neighbour himfelfct

55. But although this offence taken c nnotlje avoydedby us; yet an offence given may and ought* For God never layes uprn his a necelTity of offending.

Of the hmonr of oar Neighbour^

u T Uftice toward oar Neighbour doth cither imfBediatly I affeft him,or by meancs of foaie adion.

Jt 2, Juftice which doth in>mediatly affe^ our Neighbour , doth either refpeft the degree of that conditioa in which our Neighbour is placed 5 or the condition it {clfe ab-fiblutly confidcrcdi.

5. Asitrefpeftsthedegrceofit, it is called honour w.hidb is cooirnanded in the fift Commandcment : which is (aid to be the firft Commandement with promi/e, Eph.6,2, Either bccaufe it is the firft of the fccond Table, or becaufe it is thq. firS Comrnaadement in all the Law that bath a fin^ gular ^nd proper promlfc joyned to it.

4. Here fociety of men among thcmfelYes is (uppofed and eftabli(hed^ private or oeconomick, and publick or politick 5 wherein one ought to (erve another being joyned together in mutual! duties of Juftice and: charity, that they may exercife and (hew towards men that celigioa, whereby they v.7orfhip God. . ' t - - ;

5. Hence chat (blicary life which certaine Hermites have chofen to thcmfelvesas Angelicall, and others imbrace for other caufes, is fo farre from perfeftion, that unlefle it be pcr-Iwaded by fome extraordinary reafon (and that for a time only) it is altogether contrary tothclawandwillofGod.



Cf the hoHdur of cur Neighhur. 6. But becaufe humane fociety is as a foundation to all o-thcr offices of Juftice and charity wh'ch are commanded in the iecond table of the law : therefore thofetranfgreflions "which do direiftly make to the difturbance, confulion and o-vcrthrow of this fociety, are more grievous finncs j then the breaches of the ftverall precepts.

7. But although politicall fociety beeftabliftied of God as wei as Occonomtcall, yet as thereis fomc certain form of this Oeconomicall fas alio of Ecclefiafticali fociety} prefcribed to all people, it is not fo of politicail; but it is left to their liberty, that (fo as they prefervc their power whole) they may

prdaine that (bciety, which makes moft for the eftablifliing of religion and juliice among themfelves.

8. And this is one reafon why there is mention only of parents in the fifth precept; becaule Oeconomicall fociety only (which is plainly naturallj (hould remaineoneand the fame throughout all ages^ and nations: unto which that alfo is added, that this is the firft degree, wherein is the fountainc and feminary of all iociety 5 whence alfo the authority of all others in fuperiour power is (et forth and mitigated by the name of Father, 2 Kwgs 2.12. & 13. & I3,i4- C7^;/.41.8.43.

9. Honour is anacknowledgement of that dignity or excellency which is in another with a due teftiHcation ot it.

I o. It is called both an acknowledgement and teftifying, becaufe it confifts neither in outward obfervance only, nor in IfiiWard only^ but in both.

I r, It is (aid to refpc6lexcellency or dignity,' becaufe we are not affcfted with reverence^but upon the apprehenfion of fome excellency.

13. Hence that duty which is due to thofewho are placed above us in (omc cminency ^ is commonly and moft properly fet forth under the name of reverence; but by a fynecdof he it fcts forth every duty wherein the degree of dignity or excellency of another is rcfpeftedj whether that degree beinequall in rcfpeft of us^ or equalU £<?w. 12.10. In honour preferring' one another J i^et.^.y. Let men likewise dwell according to the knowledge of God, giving honour to the woman as to the weaker veflTcU J according to that i /'<r^2.17.

1 5. But it jiat h the firft p'ace among thofe duties tvhi ch arc due to our neighbour; Firft, becaufe it comes ncccreft to the natui e of rfligion and piety wherewith we wor(htp God, whence z\Co ic ia called religion or piety , not only by pro-phane anchors^ but romctimc alfo in the Scriptures, i Tim.^. 4. Let him learnc firft to (hew piety to his owne family, &c. Secondly, becaufe it is the bond and foundation of all other )u{licCg which is to be performed to our neighbour: for by vertae of this duty of thofe degrees which it doth refpcft,men lead iL quiet and peaceable life with all piety and honefty, iT/j^.a.Xc which doth alfo ftemc to be the proper reafon of :hac proaiife which is adjoyncd to this fifth precept,that thou iiiayeft prolong thy dayes upon earth, becaufe without this :nacuiiU obfervancc of fupcriours and inferiours among them-iclves 5 k could not be cxpcftcd that the life of man fhould a-b^de in its ftatc.

14 Honour 5 as it refpe^^s the knowledge and opinion of others of him that is to be honoured, is called fame> EccUf,^^ !. or a good name; ^/;//.4.8.

I 5. Hence honour as it is the externall good of a man^doth aot really differ from fame, but only in reafon*

16. That office of honouring which we owe to all is to pre-fcrve that ftate of dignity which they have, without being hurt.

17. Unto this office thofe vices arcoppofcd whcreby^thc fame of our neighbour is hurt.

18. The good name of our neighbour is hurt when thaf cftimation which ought to be had ot him is diminifhedj i Cor. 4.13. Being defamed we pray. 2 Cor«6.8. By honour and dit honour» by evill report and^ood report.

19. We may diminifh it either with our (elves conceiving ill of him without jufl caufc which is called rafh judgement, iW*;2^7.i. I C^rf4.3,or'withothersalfo. ^

2c. The good name of our neighbour is diminifhcd with others, by words, deeds, gcftufes, or other figncF.

7.Truth in a teftimony is threefold. i.Whenchat v;hicn is faid is conformable to the thing which is in hand. 2. When k is conformable to the mind of him that fpeaketh.j. whcntis conformable both to the thing and to the mind.

S.The fecond truth is that which ismoft properly looked at in a teftimony and in veracity : yet the third is required in iho(cthings, a certaineknojvledgeofwhichweare either bound or profeflc to have.

^•This veracity is in a fimple aflertion,or in a promife.

I o. The truth of an aflertion is al wayes thus far neccflary that if we affirme any thing, it doe conient with the mind and our judgement.

Hi Alfo fomctime an aflertion it (elfc is ncceflary when either Juftice or Charity requires it of us.

12. Juftice requires ic in publick judgements of the Judge^of theplaintifetbe detendant^of the witneflc,of the advocate,thc notary 9 and the proftor, and out of judgement when we arc bound tobeare witDeflTeby fome(peciall right.

I3# Charity requires this when good comes to our Neighbour by it, without equivalent hurt to our felves or others.

i4.Truth of a promife is called fidelity.

15tFidelity is a vertuc, whereby we are inclined to kecpc gonftantly our credit given.

i^fThis Fidelity is the foundation of civil! Juftice, and all agreements, andcontrads : for a reciprocal! promife is a Gontraft.

the like arc not lies, becaufe they are not teftimonics; and they are not teftimonics becaufe they are not confirmed by the credit aud authority of the fpeaker.

21. An mtention oi deceiving, although it doc almoftal-waycs accompany a falfc teftimony, yet it is not of theeflence of itjueither is it neccffarily required to a lie ; for although one know that he with whom he hath to doe cannot be deceived by his lic^yec if he have an intention in (peaking to affirmc that which is faife, hclyeth no Icflethen if he had hope of deceiving.

2it. An intention of hurting doth indeed increafe thcmif-chiefe of a lie; but it mafeech not the nature ©f it: for if a man, outof|eftingorade{ire toplcaft and. be officious, confirme that by his credit which he knowcs to be falfc,ic is a lie: pernicious of its own nature, if not to otherSj yet to the author himfelfras it is in thofe who are given to flatteries or boaftings, or are delighted iu confirming monftroiis fables or fiftions unto others.

25. Alfo that fecrecy whereby one doth not fpcakcthe truth when Jaftice or Gharity requires it^ doth partake of the oaturc of a lie.

t6. But when neither Juflicc nor Gharity requires to give teftimony,then the truth or part of it may be concealed with^ outfin*/^r.38.27.

27. Among lies, thofe are more hainous^in which the tefti-monic is more folerane, as in publick judgements, whlchare dhiefly refpeftcd in the words of the ninth precept ^ ia (acred mattcr^and in the like* Mat.l6.^^, i C^r.\%.i<^.

28.Hence fwbfcriptions.^teftimonieSs or commendatory Ict-terSjgiven againft the knowne truth are foulc lies.

%^. When a teftimony toward our Neighbour is confirmed by an oath^ then the oath is an ad jun(9: of that teftimony: and although it doe in it leifc refped God only, yet in this ufe it refpeSs our Neighbour alfo.

3 5* Therefore perjury in fuch a teftimony is dircdWy ami immediatly a fin againft reverence due to God : bat mediatly it violates alfothat Juftice which is due to our Neighboar.

36. Aflevcration is the manner of a teftimony whereby the fincerity of the witnefle, and the certitude of knowledge vrhich he bath of the thing witneflfed , is declared: whence alfo it is not unfitly by fbme called a proteftation, becaufeic produceth a witneffing by explication.

57. Therefore in an aflcveration there is not a ftcond con-teftation comming to the former as there is in an oath: but aa ^lluftration of one and the fame thing,

38. Neither is there any calling upon God \n a mere af-ftveration, which is eflcntiall to an oath.

39. Yet an aflevcration is not convenient but to the more, grave teftimonies, for it is as it were a middle degree between a fimple teftimo ly and an oath.

Chapter X XL

of ContentAtion.

I. X^Ontcntation is a vertue, whereby the mind doth reft I in that portion that God hath given him. i Tim.6*6. V^ Hek 135. FhiL 4.11.

a. This Contentment is commanded in the tenth Com-mandement,as appeares by the words themfelves, neither is it, any way meet that this Commandement be referred to that iiiward and original! purity of righteoufncfle, which is the fountaine of all obedience ; for that is not generally commaa^ dedinany one Commandement, but in all: neither doth it more pertaine to the ftcond table which is the condition of this precept, then to the firft.

3. Yec becaui'c of all venues which are contained in the Second table there is none more internally or more intimate to primicive righteoufiieffc then contention^and we are a? it were lead by the hand from this, to contemplate and (e^ke that 5 therefore that purity is not unfitly by occation of this precept handled here.

4. Unto this contentation is joyned joy for the profperity of our Neighbour as of our own* Rom. 12.15.

5.1n that contentment and Joy coRfifts the top and perfefti-* on of all charity toward our Neighbour. In which refpeft alfo ccatentmcnt is in a certaiac manner the pcrfeftion of godlineflc and a godly man. l Tim. 6.6. For godlmefle is great gaine ( p-st' dura^^il^d') with contentment^or producing the pcrfeftion of contentment.

6. Hence it is commanded in the laft precept according to that order which proceeds from the more imperfecSttothc more perfcft, and from that which is more known to that which is leffe knownc.

7.For this is a duty moft perfeft, and moft tinknowne to us by nature, that whatfocver we conceive or will 5 k be joyned with the good of our Neighbouri.

S.Therc-



8. Therefore although this of its own nature hath the firft place among duties to our Neighbour 3 as the foundadonof all the reft, yet becaufe it is lait in h aving a being in man cor-ruptedjtherefore ic is commanded in the laft place. p.Unto Contentation is oppofed co:Kupifcence.H^^.i3»5. 10. But by concupifcencc is not underftood the power and faculty of Infting, and defiling which is naturall:nor the acft or operation of that natiirall faculty wkich is aUo naturall and lawful!, neither the whole inclination of our nature which is corrupt, which is not fpecially condemned in any one precept^but in the whole Liw r nor allthofe chiefe aftuall luft« which areinordinate^ a great part whereof is contrary to religion and condemned in the firft table; nor laftly, all lufts which tend to the hurt of our Neighbour, for thofe which have a deliberaOe confcnc, and purpofc of profecuting joy ncd w ithxhem,are condemned in the feverall Commande-nients : But that dciirc whereby the mind is firft inftigated, and tickled , with defire of the good things which are our Neighbours, although it be not yec come into the mind to get them by unlawfuU meanes, i Kings ii..2%Mar.io*i^.

I r. By realon of that affinity,or neere consanguinity which thofe firft motions of mjuftice have with original! corrup-tion^ whence they doe arile, they are wontby many tobeas it were confounded with icBut.i. Originall fin, is as it were an inbred habit, perpetually dwelling in m, having it (elfe in refpeul of the exiftence alwayes in the fame manner^whileft €We live here; but thefcniotions are tranfient a&ions proceeding from that habit. 1. That fin dwelling in us^isno more originall, then a generall principle of all vitious afti-ons, but thofe afts, which are condemned in this place are manifeftly circumfcrlbed ^ as having refpeft only to our neighbour.

12. The Apoftle himfclfe, Rom.'].Aot\\ plainly open this precept by a Synecdoche of the operations of fin, for concu* pifccncej Ver.j, is the fame with the affections of finnerSj^'irr. 5.And withconcupifenceeffeftcd by fin, r<?r.8.

They are forfaken of all reafon.2.They are conftrained cither to roote out altogether the feconi precept of the firft Table^ Or to turnc it at leaft into a needlcflTe appendix of the firft ^ that they may (eeme to retaine in (bme fort the number of ten words^or rather (which is evident in many of them) that ab-fcuring the force of the fecond precept» thev may with fome (hew remove it fronl thcmlclves, and their fup<;iftitions, they , are conftrained to teare in funder this teniTi precept. 3 1 hey cannot certainly defigne which is the ninth, and which is chc tenth precept, becaufe in the repetition of the Law, Deptu^. 27.Govetingofthe wife is put before the coveting of the houfe 4.
