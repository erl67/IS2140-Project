neces^ry gifts of Providence, every senSfe hath something peculiar to itself, which affords it com^ fort* The eyes have beautiful colours, to give them pleasure: the ears, besides ordinary, have melodious sounds, to delight them: the taste has not only the suitableness of common food, but the sweet«» ness of honey, to please itf and. the smell, besides common odours, has fragrant flowers to regale it.— Sinful^ or unholy comfort, is the pleasure which sinners take in gratifying the»r lusts, or the, delight which they have in abusing the gifts of Divine bounty. Sometimes, the true Christian is ready to wonder how wicked men can, at any time, feel themselves comfortable: but he has no cause to wonder j for tlieir very commission of sin, is a momentary comfort to their depraved nature. ** It is as sport: to a-fopl to do mischief ^'' ** The ecorners delight in their scorning"*.'' ** Their soul delighteth in their abominations "•" To commit iniquity is agreeable to their sinftil nature^ and therefore is a comfort to it. Indeed, were it not for the frequent opportunities which they have, of gratifying some lust, either of the flesh or of the mind, life would be an Insupportable burden to them. ** Evil men," saith Solomon, " sleep not, exr-ept thoy have done nnschief: and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall ®." All ! How inexpressibfy dreadful is the condition of that man, to whose heart it is a pleasure, a comfort^ to sin against a holy, and a gracious God 1 Sinful comfort also, is the pleasure

that self-righteous persons take, in relying, either on their own righteousness wholly, or partly on the righteousness of Christ, and partly on their own, for their justification and title to eternal life; and the delight which hypocrites feel, in reflecting on their counterfeit graces and attainments.— Spirihial or holy comfort, is that inward solace or satisfaction, which supports, strengthens, and exhilarate* holy souls; and which they have in and from the Lord Jesus, their Covenant-head, by the exercise of faith, hope, love, and the other graces of the Holy Spirit p ;, or it is that spiritual delight, that holy joy, which cheers and invigorates the hearts of believerjs, under all, their inward and outward troubles. It is this only that deserves the name of pure,, solid, and durable consolation. If it is a comfort to the wicked man, amidst all his afflictions, to gratify his carnal and ungodly lusts; it cannot,. sur^, but be a real and even a great consolation to a holy man, under all the trials of life, to exercise his spiritual graees,. and to perform his holy duties* The word Comfort is, in Scripture, used in a twofold sense. It is sometimes employed to exr press that which gives consolation f but more frequently, to signify the consolation itself, which is received from it, or enjoyed by means of it. J 5/, It k employed in Scripture, to express that which givesi or is a mean of giving, consolation to the soul of an afflicted believer; whether it be a per^ son ** or a thing, ki which, by the blessing of Christ,^ comfort is hidden, and by which it is afforded ^ ; or, a word or reason, suggesting to the mind of thQ

*Rom^v. 1^-^. * Col. ivKll. 'Ps. cxlx. 76^

CBristian, matter of consolation ^ Eacli of these *s styled Comfwt^ because it is a mean or instrument of dispensing consolation to the saints* ^dy The term is, by the Spirit of inspiration, mora frequently employed to express the consolation itself^ which believers receive, whether by means of persons, or of things, or of reasons \ and which they feel or enjoy in their souls. It is in this la$t sense, chiefly, that I propose, in this treatise, to discourse of spiritual comfort.

In order to illustrate the general nature of this inestimable blessing, I shall present it, to the view of the devout reader, under the following particulars:

1. Spiritual comfort usually supposes trouble of Eome kind, either felt or feared;. or the prospect-of some difflcuU duty, to the performance of which the believer needs to be encouraged. It is under affliction, or uneasiness, that the heart of the Christian needs to be comforted. The Lord Jesus accordingly saith, ^^ Blessed are they that mourn |^. for they shall be eemfcrted ^" He made the first promise of the Holy Spirit, as a Comforter, to his disciples, when, in the. prospect of his departure from them, sorrow had filled their heart "•-** God," says the apostle Paul, *' comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any trouble ^:" and he styles him, " The God, who comforteth them that are cast down *.'* The soul, that it may be qualified for spiritual consolation, must be quicken-^ ed and humbled* It is *^ the spirit of the humble,.

• Ps. cxix. 50. 2 Cor. i. 4. ^ Msitt. v. 4.

and the heart of the contrite ones,*' that the Kigff and lofty One will revive with holy comfort ^. Indeed, the oil of spiritual joy is such, that no vessel but a contrite heart, can hold it. The design of imparting^ Divine consolation, i& to cheer and invigorate the drooping spirit. The office of the Comforter is, to relieve the disconsolate soul ^. It is impossible for them who- have never felt the* uneasiness of a wounded conscience, to value, or to desire, the joy of God's salvation.—The soul, that it may need, and be prepared for, true consolation, must not only be quickened and humbled', but be under some affliction^ either felt or apprehended. Comfort, according to an apostolical direction, is to be administered to '* the feeble-minded * j'' to such as are ready to staler under the cross, and* to be overset by the temptations of Satan aiid the world, or discouraged because of the corruptions of their own hearts- It is trouble, that renders spiritual consolation necessary, as weU as desirable. If the believer were not feeble, and incapable of being supported by a created arm, the office of a Divine Comforter would be unnecessary. If he had not a painful, as well as a spiritual, sense of his want of heavenly consolations, earthly comforts would be more acceptable to him tharr they: and if his heart-were not prepared for them, by being humbled, as well as afflicted", they would^ no more refresh it, than a shower af rain would refresh a rock. Accordingly, Christ seldom communicates sensible comfort to the saints, but wheiv ihey are either in inward or outward trouble.

> Isn. Wik 15. » Lam. ul6. •' 1 Thess v. l-fc

It Is by their being troubled, that they become disconsolate, and so become fit for being consoled: and it is tlieir sharpest afflictions, that often serve to prepare them for the sweetest consolations. He, therefore, brings them usually into the wil< demess, before he speaks comfortably to them*^. It may be proper here to remark that, as Divine comfort is the opposite e( trouble^, so it must be more powerful and effectual, than either outward or inward trouble; for there is no prevailing, but by that which is the stronger: it must be more forcible to raise up the dejected soul, than the grievance is, .o cast it down ; otherwise it <;annot at the time, be comfort to it.

2, There are three degrees of spiritual comfort: the lowest degree is peace of conscience ; the next is joy; and the highest is triumph.

Peace of conscience is that inward serenity, or tranquillity of mind, which arises from the faith and sense of being justified in the sight of God, or of being in a state of union with Christ, and of conformity to him. *^ Being justified by faith," says the apostle Paul, ** we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ**." The peace, with which the God of hope fiUeth the hearts of the saints, is peace in believing \ It arises also

*> Hos. ii. 14.

^ Luther says, that * All tilings come from Christ to lit church, in contraries : he is righteousness, but it is in sin felt: he is life, but it is in death : he is consolation, but it is in calamity.' Augustine likewise observes, that * the Christian's life runs on between these two^ our crosses and God's comforts*'

* Bom. v, 1. * Koro. xv. 13.





fronr tlie setise^ err consciousness of peace with Gotf, When the blood of Christ is^ by faith, applied to ihe conscience, the conscience h purged, by it from dead works ^; and the heart also is, at the same time, sprinkled by it from an evil conscience*. The subject of spiritual peace, is a conscience tliat is purged. Purity and peace are connected together in the conscience; and they are both necessary to render it a good conscience \ When the conscience is sprinkled with the blood of Jesus, it is thereby set free from the dread of re-Tenging wrath. The mind is not as formerly,r disturbed with alarming fears of God s indignation^ nor disquieted by his judgments '\ This is accompanied usually, with a cordial acquiescence in the will of the Lord, feunded on a persuasion of his wisdom and sovei'eignty, oi his holiness and goodness: and so far as a man attains this holy acquiescence in the Divine will, he is secure from disappointment; and free from uneasiness. Now, this peaceful serenity of soul, is the first degree of spiritual comfort When the Lord Jesus would comfort his disconsolate disciples, he said, " These things I have spoken to you, that in me ye might have peace ^J*

Joy is a higher degree of'holy consolation. Spiritual joy is that gladness of heart, which flows li'om die lively ex^cise of faith, feasting upoi> Christ in the offers and promises of the gospel. Tlie apostle Paul prayed thus for the behevers at Rome; •* Now the God of hope, fill you with

^jProv^ i. 53. ^ Joha xvi. 33, ' Rom. xv. I3«.

* ■ .

Ajoj and peace in believing * t" and the apostle Peter said to the Christians of the dispersion, *• Believing^ ye rejoice"^." It is a holy delight,. in living upon Christy and in walking in him; and it is effected by the Holy. Spirit shedding abroad in the heart, like a fragrant perfume, the love of God. When he graciously condescends to admi«-nister that reviving cordial, it elevates and en^^ larges the fainting souL Arising, as it does, from ' the begun enjoyment, and from the hope of the full and endless enjoyment of God in Christ, it strengthens, and so comforts the drooping heart. .** The joy of the Lord,'* saith Neberaiah, '* is your strength "." Peace is negative; joy is positive comfort: the former is as the calming of the storm; the latter, as the breaking out of the sun : that is a mitigation of trouble ; tiiis, a sense of positive enjoyment. When a condemned criminal knows that he is pardoned, he has peace ;. but when he is besides advanced to preferment, he has joy.

Triumph is the highest degree of consolation* The saints triumph, when they so greatly rejoice,, as almost to shout for joy, on account of the victory given them over their spiritual enemies. They triumph,, when, more than conquerors through him who loved them^they exult or re--joice, in their almighty Redeemer, with rapturous deh'ght. This was often the attainment of the holy apostle Paul, and of his fellow-labourers in the gospel <^ Thanks be unto God,^' says he, ** which alwaifs csLUseth us to triumph in Christ-V^

f I' Pet, i. 8. " Neb. viii. 10. "" Z Cor. ii, 14.

A6

A lofty description of this their triumph, Se giveth in Rom. riii. 31—39. Hbw high did heavenly consolation rise, in the soul of that holy apostle, when he was writing that sublime passage! In like manner does the believer triumph^ when*, in his pursuit of more communion with Christ, and eonformity to him, he is enabled to van^ish great opposition. In some happy moments of his life, his joy, like a river swelled by impetuous rains, bursteth all its banks, and carrieth all the joys and all the sorrows of this world before it. It is then, especially, that it may be styled, " Joy unspeakable and full of glory p." It i» glorious in itself, and is attended with glorying in the Lord Jesus. When the heart of the Christian is elevated to this degree of consolation, he glories in the Lord. All that is in this'^ world is brought under him: the greatest calamities cannot daunt him. He sete Christ, and God in Christ, against all enemies and all evils, whether external or internal. This triumphant glorying in the Lord, is like that of the lioly Psabnist, who said, *^ My soul shall make her boast in ^be Lord^." It is remarkable, that these three degrees of spiritual comfort are, by our apostle, mentioned m a single passage ^: *^ We have," says he, '^ peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Chri6t>..we rejoice in hope ;...and nolh only so, but we glory in tribulations also."

3. Spiritual consolation is^ according to the covenant of grace, given to believers, by God the Fa«> tber, by Christ the second Adam, frnd.by the Holy Spirit. God the Father giveth it, by sovereign and

^ I Pet. k 8. * P«. xxaIv. «. ' Bom. v. 1—S.

jcrdiciary authority; Christ the mediator^ by grai* clous dispensation; and the Holy Spirit, by effectual operation. God the Father ordainetli it for his children *; Christ the last Adam, administers it; and the blessed Spirit, as the Spirit of Christ, applieth it to them.

Holy consolation is given them by God the Fa^ tka\ None but Jehovah himself, can pour consolation into a troubled soul. All true comfort is, originally and fundamentally in Him. He it is, whom the apostle Paul styles, ^^ The God of all comfort, who comforteththe saints in all their tribulation *}" and, •* The Father, who hath loved them, and hath given them everlasting consolation *».** He also calls him, ** The God of consolation ^y and ** The Comforter of those that are "cast dow»V* The Lord compareth himself to a father pitying his children y, and to a mother comforting, with tenderest concern, her a£> flicted infant^. He chargeth his servants, << to strengthen the weak hands, to confirm the feeble knees, and to say feo them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not; behold your God will come wkh vengeance, even God with a recom*-pense, he will come and save you *." He suffered his only and beloved Son to be, in ail points^ tempted like as his people are, that he might sympathise with, and comfort them, under all their temptations.

Comfort is administered to them by Jesm Christy

their Covenant-bead. The Lord Jesus is die* Trustee, the store-house, of all spiritual comfort, to 'the saints: from Hira, as the hope set before them, they may daily derive strong consolation. Hence he is styled, " The Consolation of Israel ^.** He is the matter of his people's consolation ; the Prince of peace, the true Noah, *« who comibrteth thein, concerning the work- and toil of their hands.*' It is a part of bis high office, to which he was anoihted by the blessed Spirit, " to comfort them who mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise, for the spirit of heaviness ^." There is therefore •* consolation in Christ ** j" and the consolation of the saints aboundeth by Christ^: they have it, in him and through him, with him and by him. His person, righteousness, fulness, and love, are the source and substance of abun« dant consolation to them, iagmnst trouble of every kind. He it is, v9^ho giveth peace to his people: and " when He giveth quietness, who then can make trouble ^?" Nothing can comfort the heart without Christ He removes from the soul, all that is dismal, and bestows upon it, all that is comfortable. He it is, who maketh even the darkness of trouble itself, to be light before them who trust in him. He is the Sun of righteousness, whose light, and warmth, and healing, cheer their souls. When he vouchsafes his reviving presence to them, he leaves a delightful perfume of comfort behind him. Indeed) a man can never know what true

^ Luke 11. 25. « Im. Ixi. 2, 3. «» Phil, ii, 1. *-f CflTr L 5. ^ Job. x»iv» 29..

pleasure is, till he know Christ. The compaa* aionate Redeemer, tliere&re, saith to aU who are weary, toiling in a fruitless pursuit of happiness^ and also to all who are heavy laden, oppressed with the servitude of sin, or bowed down under a load of misery, ** Come imto me, and I will give you rest V

Comfort is applied to the saints by the Holy Spi' rit. He is therefore styled, ** The Comforter **•'* Being the inestimable gift of the Father, through the mediation of the Son, he is ^^ another Com* forter *." The adorable Spirit dischargeth this^ his office, by testifying of Christ, or by taking of the things of Christ, and shewing them to be^ lievers 5 by opening and applying the promises of the everlasting covenant to them, and by enabling, them to believe these, with application to themselves ; by shedding abroad the love of the Father and of the Son, in their hearts ; by witnessing ta tliem their adoption, and their being heirs of Uod^ and joint-heirs vdth Christ; by abiding in thenv as the seal, the earnest, and the pledge, of their eternal inheritance; and by dwelling in them, as the Spirit of grace and of Supplications.. The Holy Spirit, like Noah's dove, flreth with the olive-leaf of peace, to assure believers, that ** the winter is-past, and that the rain is over and gone." He not only bringeth words of comfort to their remembrance, but opens their hearts to receive them.. ComfcNTts may be so applied as to be brought close to the heart $ but, if the heart do aot open for

• Matth. nu 28. ^ Joho xv. 2(5. ' Johnxiv. 16.

thekn, no consolation is experienced. The Spirft, therefore, not only openeth and applieth the promises to the heart; but, openeth the heart for the comfort of the promises 5 and then pours consola-lion into it. He comforts the saints also, by enabling them to trust that, in the Lord Jesus, they have righteousness and strength, forgiveness of sins, and a title to eternal life; as wiell as, by renewing them after the image of the Son of Grod, and so, uniting their hearts to the holy will of God. The original word, in the New Testament, which wfe have translated, a Comforter *, signifies likewise, an Advocate. One special way, in which, the Holy Spirit comforts believers, is tlie exercise of his Advocacy or intercession in them '. The more they are enabled to pray in faith, the more do they walk in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost".

4. The spiritual consolation, which is given to believers, is apart of eternal life. ** Believing ye rejoice **.** " He that beheveth on the Son, kath everlasting life ®.** One part of the fruit of the Spirit, when he imparteth spiritual life to the soul, iff joy P. Bat spiritual life in the souP, i« eternal life begun. When God who cannot lie,- promised, before the world began, eternal life to the second Adam for his spiritual seed; he promised to him, that, upon condition of his bearing their griefs, and carrying their sorrows, they should become heirs of everlasting joy, and heirs of himself as their exceeding joy. As the saving knowledge

* Johtt xiv. 16. ^ Rom^ viii. 26. "* Acts ix. 31. 'iFet.ud. • John iii. 36t P Gal. v. 2ii.

of Christ, in this world, is the earnest, and be>-ginning of the beatific vision of God and the Lamb, in the heavenly world, and as conformity to Christ in holiness here, is the beginning of perfect conformity to him there ; so the consolation, which the saints, on some occasions^ feel, in this valley of tears, is the first fruits or beginning of that fulness of joy, which will constitute a part of their blessedness, in that holy place on high. The joy of the Holy Ghost, which enters into them here, is the same in kind, as the joy of their Lord, into which they will enter hereafter. It is therefore, by one apostle, styled " Everlasting consolation**,'* and by another, " Joy unspeakable and full of glory ^/' It is joy that is full of glory, or glorious joy; the very dawning of the day of glory. Holy consolation, is glory begun in the soul; a bud, which will open in heaven, and spread into inefiable and endless glory; a dawn, which wiU shine more and more, until the glorious San of righteousness, brighten it into perfect and eternal day. All the joy of the saints below, is but as a spark, a feeble spark, compared to that blaze of rapture, wluch will burn intensely in their spirits above. It is but a slight foretaste, a small drop, of that immense ocean of uimiingled joy, which they are to inherit in the mansions of glory. Although they are not fai* from the heavenly Canaim ; yet their hearts are often ready to faint, under their sufierings from without, and their conflicts with corruption from within: but a taste of the grapes of Eshcol, the first fruits of heaven, revives their

« £ Tbesa. ii. 16. M "Pel* v ^

•

spirit) rouses their zeal» and quickens their de^re of that endless rest, which there remaineth for them. Consolation keeps the holy soul upon the wing, and increases her strength. It is the very life of the soul. When Naomi would express the comfort that Boaz should aiFord to Ruth, she said to her, ** He shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life*." If the contentment and delight of the heart be taken away, it dieth. The souls of the wicked, have an existence in hell; yet, because it is an existence without comfort, their state is never said in Scripture, to be a state of life, but on the contrary, a state of death. Accordingly, the irestoring of comfort to moumersj is called, a r^---viving of them \

5, The grounds and sources of holy consolation, are especially the following: God in Christ, with all his glorious perfections, as a God of love,^ grace, and mercy, and as the God and portion of the saints " ; Christ, in his glorious Person "^^ ]:ighteousness *, fulness,, offices, and relations, or Christ living in tkem', and living for them*^; the Holy Spirit, as inhabiting, quickening, sanc-< Cfying, and sealing them, and as the earnest of their eternal inheritance *; the covenant of grace, as well ordered in all things and sure, according to wliich, Jehovah, Father, Son, and. Holy Ghost, is their God, and they are his peo-pie, his peculiar people ^ ; the infinite atone-

Blent ^, the continual intercession ^, the supreme do* minion, the inviolable faithfulness, and the gracious presence, of the Lord Jesus, who is given for a covenant of the people; and the ordinances, doctrines, promises, and ofiers, of his gospel ^, with the peremptory commandment, given to sinners in common, to believe on him ^: these are the leading, and the immediate grounds^ upon which, the saints do by faith, build their comfort; and they are, at the same time, the sources^ from which, by the exercise of faith, they derive their consolation. Besides these,, their faith and sense of the pardon of their sins, of the acceptance of their persons as righteous, of their adoptiofi, of their sanctification, and of the witnessing of the blessed Spirit, are matter of consolation to them; and so is the lively exercise of all the graces of the Holy Spirit, especially of faith, hope^ and love. The comfort of justification, because it is founded upon a righteousness which is perfect^ and always the same, is more stable and perma-sent, than that of sanctification. The great things,, which believers have in possession, and the great*^ er, which they have in hope, are the sustenance of their consolation ^. The suitableness of those inestimable blessings to their hearts ^, together with their sense of personal interest in them, afibrdsthem unspeakable joy *. As to their experiences and evidences of grace, these are, strictly speaking,, not grounds^ upon which they build their comfort ^i,

is sown for the upright in heart; and though, like seed sown in winter, which lies long under the dod, it seems to be lost; yet, it is preserved, and it will in due season spring up to view, and yield s plentiful increase. Though the seed of consola* tion appointed for the saints, may lie covered for a time, yet it is not destroyed. Believers have at all times, the seed or principle^ and also the habit of spiritual joy, in their hearts. Even in their deepest dejection, they have a seed of comfort that will spring up. The fruit of the Spirit in them, is Joy and peace; and the Spirit as a Comforter, abid-eth with them for ever **. But although they always have the principle, yet they have not, at all times, the sensible enjoyment, of comfort. They do not continuatiy, exercise the grace of joy; and therefore, they do not always see or feel in themselves, the principle and habit of that grace. It is, when they are exercising any grace of the Spirit, that they commonly per<;dve it. Tlieir sensible enjoyment of consolation in this life, is often interrupted, by the riMnaining corruptions of their nature, by the fiery ^arl» of the wicked one, and by the hidings of God's countenance from thcnu In interrupting their sensible comfort, they themselves have a sinftd hand ^; Satan and his instruments, have a malicious hand ^; and the Lord, in order to manifest his sovereignty, to chasten them for their sins, to try and exercise their graces, to excite their more earnest prayers, and to teach them to improve for the future the sense of his favour,

«

tath a holy hand ^. Hence, though the teliever is, sometimes, lively, and in his exercise of faith •and love, feels at his heart, a glow of heavenly joy; yet,^at other times, he is languid, cold, and in a great degree disconsolate. Like Hagar at the well, his eyes are so held, Aat he cannot perceive as formerly, <bis grounds of comfort; and then, his dsiy of gladness, is turned into a night (^ heaviness',

of heart for sin' ^ the time in which, they are inore than ordinariJy engaged in the exercise of grace, and practice of duty, and especially, when they are conflicting much, witli the corruptions of tl^eir heart ^ i after sharp conflicts with sin or temptation, from which, they have come off* victorious^ ; tlic season in whici), the Lord i€ calling them to some extraordinary service, for which, they need special encouragement™; the time in which, itlicy «©e 'BXvA find least comfort in creatures, or in which, thev are d^titute of creature-com-forts, and are enabled more than usually todespi-se^ them, in c€WTyparii>on of 'Cluist and God m him; the season in which, the Lord confers upon them, isome remarkable and unexpected favour " ; and the lime in ^vliich, they employ themselves in fixed and deep meditation on tlie adorable Redeemer, and his glorious grace °, These are, for the most |>art, the oi'dinary seasons of sensible comfort, to the saiiits. But, as the Lord is infinitely sovereign, wise, and gracious, in dispensing his blessings to them; there are also some extraordinary seasons of rgoicing; some ineffable glances of light, upon their souls, which penetrate, transform, and fill them with rapturous and inexpressible joy.

9. The comfort which the Lord bestoweth, is,, in every instance, the most suitable to the present necessity of the believer. " As thy days," saith Moses, " so shall thy strength be p." The Chris-

tianTs comforts ore wiiely and wondcrfally adapted to tlie nature, degree, and continuance, of hin grievances. When be kas the most discpurage-ment iiritfaout, be haa usually the most consola^ tion within^ when the Lord Jesus giveth him lealt 0f oreature-comfbrt, he commonly ^ords him moit of himself, as the Consolation of Israel. He seldom allows him, mtich of the fatness of the earth, and of rdheshment from above, at once; but when he cifaatteth befiDTe him, all doors of help from thki world, he openeth to him the doors of heaven* It was only, when the Martyr Stephen'saw nothing but death for him in this world, that he saw <* the lieavcns opened, and the Son of man, standing on the right hand of God ^.** When the Lord bring-ctli his people into outward straits, he commonly favours them with inward enlargements: when he jiuttcth a cup of affliction into their hands, he usually giveth them a cup of consolation. ** Will lie plead against me, saith Job, with his great power ? No; but he would put strength in me'." The Lortl Jesus said to Paul, when he was afflict* •cd by a thorn in the flesh, " My strength is made perfect in weakness *." The time, in which, bo--llevers arc most sensible of their ,utter inability, to resist and overcome their comiptions, or temptations, and arc most engaged in relying on their great Kcdeemer, fi)r strength; is the season, in which, by supporting tmd strengthening them, He usually ttfForfs tlrcm, the most illustrious displays of the perfection of his strength. In proportion as their weakness appt^ars to them, will his strength

^appear perfect, in comforting or strengthening jtheir souls, under that weakness. Accordhigly, the apostle in another place saith, " As the sufferings x>f Christ abound in us» so our consolation also .aboundeth by Christ ^" The comfort afforded jto the saints, is admirably fitted and proportioned, to their sufferings in conformity to Christ, and es-pecialjy, to their sufferings for him. If. the one aboundeth, so does the other, and that, in the most (Suitable and eKact proportion. If gall be dropped into their.cup, a suitable proportion of sweetness, .will also be infused ; so that, their affliction wUl be .in measure ". If they be under various troubles, and trust in Christ, he hath various comforts for them: if they labour under powerful evils, he hath strong consolations; if, under new afflictions, he hath new. comforts; if, under smaU grievances, he hath small degrees of support to bestow; if, under great perplexities, he hath great measures of consolation to impart ; if, in deep distresses, he hath deep comforts, comforts, that will sink to the very .centre of the soul; and if, under continued trials, .whether external ch* internal, he hath continued, yea, everlasting consolations, to giv€ them. He *^ will not suffer them to be tempted, above that they are able; but will with the temptation, also make a way to escape, that they may be able to bear it ^.'' He will either bring down the trial to their strength, or bring up their strength to the trial. If, accordingly, their holy consolation be at any time small j it is because they are then not exposed, as at other times, either to outward tempta-

dons, or to inward conflicts. So long as believers^ are liable to yield to the prevalence of unbelief^ pride, indolence, an inordinate attachment to earthly things, and a legal temper; the Lord is pleased^ to bestow or suspend, to restore or increase, spiri-^ tiial consolation, at such seasons,* and in such de<^ grees, as he sees most suitable, to prevent or control those evils, and to promote the increase of holiness in their souls ^. Seeing true comfort is an inward strengthening of the soul, agaiust trouble felt or feared, it must, as was hinted above, be stronger than the trouble, else the act of comforting will not follow. If the comfort be not above the uneasiness, it is no longer comfort. No comforts, therefore, but such as are Divine^ can refresh the holy soul under trouble ^ because, in all other comforts, the disease is above the remedy. Be-Kevers should never be discouraged,- in the pros-^ pect even of the highest degree of affliction; for the spiritual comfort, will be so adapted to the trouble, as to rise above, and prevail over it ^. It is therefore better for them, to have the consola-tion, than to be exempted from the trouble, and to want the consolation. This is one special advantage of an afflicted condition, to the saints, that the Lord Jesus pities them most, and com torts tiiem most, in that condition. It is commonly, w lien Satan, or the world, or the flesh, is most bitter to them, that he and his grace are most sweet. Indeed, his sharpest dispensations would often be his sweetest, if they but knew better, how to improve them. 10. The spiritual comfort of the saints, is accord-

II. The properties of spiritual Cbn^olation, by whichi it is distinguished from the joy of the hy-^ pocrite, are these :—

True comfort cometh by the ttror^f of God, and that Tightly understood *; but delusive joy comes, either by impressions without the word, or by a misunder^ standing of the word. True consolation is real and solicL The sadness of the believer is, as it were^--but as seeming sadness j whereas his joy is reaL *' As sofrowful/'saith Paul, ** yet always rejoicing"*.-The hypocrite, on the contrary, is only in appear* ance joyful; whilst he is in reality gloomy, and sorrowful". Spiritual comfort goes to the hearty and inspires it with holy delight: it i^solid, mndr dwells more in the heart, than in the countenanccr But delusive joy floats on the surface, makes a loud-noise, and is, therefore, compared to " the crackling of thorns under a pot**.'* True comfort, with regard to it3 object, is a rejoicing more in the amia^ Ueness and excellence of Christ, manifested, than inr the manifestation of them P; but countOFfeit joy, is a repicing more in the manifestation itself, than in the exceUenoe oi the Divine obgect, manifested. The true Christi^ti, rejoices most in the holy, and amiable nature of the things of Christ: the formal-list^ delights most in hi» own pretended interest in those things. That which delights him, is not so' much the beauty of the Lord, as the beauty of his own experience.

On the contrary,, the delusive joy of flio formalist, will, either in time or in eternity^ be matter of sorrow to him ^ True comfort is hidden from unregenerate men ^\ It is as far out of the reach of worldly menv to discern the spiritual joy of a saint; asitis out of their power, to^ prevent, or to r^noT^ it. The consolation of the sinoero Christimi, is unspeakable ^^'j and no wonder;, for the matter, and tho importance of it^ are in* comprehiDnsible; but the greatest joy of the hypo-crit& and the worldling, can es^ily be told ; it can^, without difUculty, be expressed to the utmost of its value.

It is by the Holy: Spirit so fixed in the heart, that it can never be*^ wholly removed; and it is so strong, that it swallows up almost, aU matter of unwarrantable fear and grief. Indeed, when the believer hath lost aU sight of his personal interest in the Saviour, he cannot, as formerly, exercise his joy m God, and* cannot, in such a case, but lose the sense of that' joy, even while the principle and habit of it still remain. But, though the hypocrite's persuasion of his pretended interest in the Divine favour, continues; yet his joy ceases: his sense of that interest^ becomes insipid to him K

12. In proportion to the degree of holy consolation that is affcnded the believer, his dttty is his de^ light. Being renewed in thespirit of his mind, the more clearly and spiritually, he discerns the loveliness of God in Christ, and the more cordially and-firmly, he believes his love to him ; the more dotlr he love God \ and the more he loveth God, the more he delighteth in Him. In proportion^ also^ as he spiritually discerns the infinite amiableness of the holiness, and the other perfections of God, and believes with application his redeeming love f he, in the same proportion, approves Him, and the manifestations of his glory in the face of Jesu» Christ: but the more he approves, or is pleased with God, as gloriously manifested in Christ, the more delight does he take in him. Add to this, that the more he is enabled to trust cordially, that

God in Christ loveth him, and that He is not Ihis enemy, but his Friend and his Father; the more of spiritual comfort, he .will have; and the more of that holy consolation he has, which is a rejoicing in the Lord, the more will he delight in him, as his own God and Father. Now, in proportion as the believer is enabled to love^ to be pleased mthf and to rejoice in God, through the Lord Jesus Christ; he is at the same time, enabled to delight in the infinite holviess of God^ as his* God in Christ, and in all the iUustriou» displays of it, which, especially in redemption, are afforded him "*. And because the moral law, in the hand of the glorious Mediator, is a fair transcript of God's holiness, and a declaration of his will, the believer delighteth also in that law, after the inward man "• He lovetli it, because it is holy and just ^ ; and he consents unto it, that it is good K In the same degree, then, in which a holy man is delighted or comforted, by a spiritual discovery of the transcendent loveliness of Jehovah, and by a firm belief of his infinite love to him ; does he de-. Hgbt in his holy commandments: but, the more he . delights in the commandments of the Lord, the Hiore pleasure doth he take, in iq^iritual and uni^ Tersal obedience to them ^.

The- more his^ heart is comforted, the more w.iJl it be a comfort to him, tomortily sIb^ ami to practise holiness;, the more unifonniy, will he rejoice in all opportunities of doing good, and the more, ardently-y will ha seize them ^.

The ipore fib holy soul is invi^jorated with spiritual consolation, the morer active and cheerful he is, in all his-dufies; for in- proportion as be delights in them,^. they are easy ta him *.

In order that he might not; through the canity and deceiti* fulness of his heart, be elated with an unbecoming, conceit of himself, as if he were better than other apostles,, because of the abundance of the revela*-fo'ons, with which he badi been favoured ;. the Lord employed means the most effectual, to keep him humble.

A Prophet, personating the an»» eient church in her captivity, says,. " Thou hast lifted me up and easfc me down y."

order to prevent his being intoxicated, seeth it ne^ cessary to mingle water with his wine. He sees, it may be, that when the outward path of the Christian is smooth, he is not, in such a case, fil to be trusted with inward consolation, except in a small measure. He, therefore, in his infinite wisdom and love, varies his dispensations to the believer. By a wise interchange of adversi^^y and prosperity, he sets trouble and comfort, for the most part, the one, over against the other * j that the one may be a foil to the other; that the Christian may find a c»hort, an easy, and a safe passage between themf that in adversity, ** he may weep, as though he wept not," and in pros{ierity, " rejoice, as though-he rejoiced not *." Indeed, so long as sin remain-eth in the believer, he must, in order to grow in grace, have distress and comfort, either alternately,. or both together j to the end that, when he is sorrowful, he may not be cast down too low, and that, whenhe is rejoicing, he maynot be lifted up too high. -

Are Christ and God in Christ, together with his grace, mercy, and truth, as hath been said above^ thepi'imary grcuiids oi Si saints comfor-t and hope? I hence infer that, hk manifold infirmities and deficiencies, in his exercise of grace and performance of duty, should ap no time discourage him. Belie* ver, thy remaining darkneasj deadness, carnality, weakness, and indisposition of spirit for holy exercises, should indeed occasion in thy soul, much godly sorrow and self-loathing; but, they should never discourage thee in thy holy endeavours, nor cawsa thee to- despond.- They should not make

Be not disquieted, then, though thou feelest the corruption of thy nature, strong and active; while thou findest, at the same time, thy renewed nature, striving in opposition to it, and mourning under a painful sense of it. Unbelieving discouragement, arising from a sense either of sins or of wants, of desertions or of temptations, will weaken thy hands, and indispose thy heart for spiritual obedience ^. It was when Peter began to fear, that he began to sink in the waten Doth the Lord Jesus, usually afford inward and sensible comfort to his children, about the time of their first conversion ? They may see in this, an illustrious display of his manifold wisdom^ as well as of his redeeming love to them. One thing that he designs by this, is, that they may perceive as early as possible, the inexpressible advantages, that they have gained by the gracious change, which his Holy Spirit hath produced in them; and thereby be encouraged, as well as inclined, so to run the race that is set before them, as to attain the prize of inexpressible and endless joy, in his immediate presence.

influence, from* a' marfs natural constitution of body; this, is inward and holy, and is eflfectfed by the Holy Spirit the Comforter, dwelling in the-soul. Spiritual consolation is sometimes sensible, as well as that which is natural; or rather, the former might (as it sometimes is) be styled, sensi--ble consolation, and the latter, sensitive delight. Spiritual comfort, delights chiefly the rational and inward faculties of the soul; natural comfort, pleases only the outward and sensitive faculties of it, namely, the imagination, the natural »pirit»j and even the external senses. The former, i* wrought in the heart, by the Holy Spirit, according to the word, spiritually understood and believed ; the latter, is often produced by the external manner of the reader or preacher of the word ; such as, his elocution, tone, and action. Persons of a soft natural constitution of body, have this sensitive delight, oftener, and in greater measure, than they of a contrary temperament. When the one, is enjoyed by the saints, they commonly can assign some reason for it; when the other, is felt by persons of any description, they usually can give no reason for the delightful sensation; but only that, something they know not what, has made a pleasing impression upon them. Spiritual comfort, is the opposite of trouble of mind on spiritual accounts; natural comfort, is the opposite of melancholy, which is a bodily disease: the former, as I already observed, is the special work of the Holy Spirit, in the hearts of sincere believers ; the latter, proceeds from natural and external causes y and it is pften raised by Satan, in order to confirm s'mners in their delusion and hypocrisy. Th^

hypocrites in Zion, mentioned by Isaiah^, " took delight in approaching to God ;*' and the hearers compared by our Lord to the stony ground, ** immediately received the word with glailness'.** Thus it appears, that thousands of men and women, whose unholy lives, demonstrate them to be utter strangers to spiritual and holy consolation, have, nevertheless, on some occasions, much natural and sensible delight. Let no man therefore ccmclude, that he is a true Christian, merely because he has felt much sensible, and even transporting joy; for his joy may be nothing but a natural sensation.

Once more: Is holy consolation peaiJiar to holy persons ? Then it doth not belong to unholy men. The same spiritual comfort, tliat the saints have received, is, in the gospel, offered freely to thee ivho livest in the love and practice of some known ^in; and the authentic offer, affords thee a warrant to receive it; but no warrant, to receive it separate from Christ, or otherwise than by receiving hinpi) with his righteousness and salvation. It, indeed, affords thee a right to trust in the Lord Jesus, for all his salvation, and for holy consolation ^s a part of it; but, no right to trust that he will give thee comfort, apart from salvation; no warrant to trust that he will afford thee spiritual consolation, in the love' and practice of any iniquity. Thou canst •* not rejoice for joy, as other people ;'^ for thou hast no personal interest in Jesus, the Consolation of Israel.

<5r THE GREAT IMPORTANCE AKD USEFULNESS OF bPIRITUAL COMFORT, TO THE «AINTS«

J ME high importance and utility of spiritual consolation, in qualifying believers for the lively exercise of their graces, and the spiritual peformance of their duties, will appear, if the following particulars be considered:

1. It ist>f such uns2)cakable consequence to them,

' Isa. Iv. 1, 2, 3,

that the eternal Father hath, in the gr^tness of his love, sen^ his only begotten Son into the world, with a commis3ion iopurchase it for them. The Father, according to his eternal covenant with the Son as last Adam, ^nt him, in order that he might bear iheir griefs, a^d carry their sorrows; and so might, at the infinite expense of his miparalleled anguish^ agony, and death, purchase for them, the comfort which they, in the first Adam, had forfeited. He sent his only, his dear Son, to endure the pains of eternal death for them, that they might enjoy, in union with Him, the comfort of eternal life; that , they might enter into Zion, with songs of triumph in their lips, and with everlasting joy on their headfiU The Lord Jesus himself hath declared, that the comforting of mourners in Zion, was a principal object of his mission into the world. ** The Spirit of the Lord God," saith he, " is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek: He hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted 5...to comfort all that mourn; to give unto them that mourn in Zion, beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness '^." The Father hath also exalted him, in the human nature, to universal dominion j on purpose that, he might dispense the comfort of salvation, to all who should believe in him. Accordingly, when he was about to leave the world, the legacy which he left to his disciples, wiis comfort ^. He promised that, their sorrow should be turned into joy; and that, in him, they should have peace, when, in the world, they

So great is'tbe importh-ance of Divine consolation to the saints, Bnd to the glory of God in their salvation; that the Father and the Son, send the Holy Spirit, to apply it to iheir souls. Tlie Spirit, accordingly, testifieth of -Christ ° $ witnesseth thdr adoption into the family of God I and seals them to the day of redemption^ In performing these offices, he invigorates and xheers their hearts. Nay, so important, so excel-'hsktf is spiritud comfort, in the estimation of Gody ^thift God the Father, assumeth this title, " Thq. -God of consolation °," ** The God of all com^ fortP:" God the Son, is styled, " The Consolation of Israel ^$" and God the adorable Spirit, is distinguidied by this cheering title, ^^ The Com-•forter "^.^ In few words, so high is tlie value, which the Lord setteth upon -holy comfort, that he gives this solemn charge to the ministers of his word': '^* Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees. Say to 'them that are of a fearful heart. Be strong, fear not^." Dolmen set such a high value upon earthly comforts, as to pursue^ with unwearied diligence, the enjoyment of them ?

Indeed, as Luther says, to comfort the heart, is store than to create.a world. How inexpressiUy powerfal and ^rateful^ is heavesly conscJation, to the dis-treased soul! When David had been under great :tr«uble, when a flood of bitter waters, had oversowed his soul; the Loiid let && a drop or two of lieay^y comfort, and aQ was turned unto sweetness^. O the znconeeivable excellence, theim-iwralleled-sweetness, of Divine consolation!

8. The high in^ortance of spiritual comfort, win also appear, if we consider that, it is the pujpe -delight which saints have, in common wrik holy an" gels. The pleasures of sense, are such as bdlevers have, in common with irrational creatures; the pleasures merely "of reason, are such as they attala • equally with oUiermen; but the ddights of com-* munion with God, are such as they enjoy in com-, mon with the an^Is of light. They are not, indeed, the same in degree, as the joys of angels, bat they are the same in kind. They a^e the plea-. sures of a soul, and not of bodily sense; the de-^ lights of « holy soul, and not of a carnal mind* Theipleasttres of true religion, do immediately a& teat llie soul, that part cf a holy man, by which he, is allied to the worM of spirits; and therefore they are to.be regarded, as the only sublime, the only lame, pleasures of a man. When hdy souls are iitooiibrtedf they are entertained .tus with woigdf

'^od. Their consolation is not only spiritual, an3 thereftft'e suitable to a holy and immortal spirit; 'but, it is substantial and satisfying, heavenly and . glorious *. Their joy is, in its own nature, unspeakably glorious, and is accompanied with glorying in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ It is truly honourable, and is the earnest of glory, in their souls. Wlien sinners have ** come to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling i" they so '* come-to an innumerable -company of angels^* as, in some measure, to p)ir-ticipate with them, -in-that sublime that celestial delight, which they always enjoy, in the presence ^cf God and the Lamb. They then, begin to imitate the holy und blessed angds, in delighting in objects of the greatest worth, and especially, in the mil and the glof^/ of God in Christ.

4. Spiritual consolation is of such consequence to 43elievers, and to the glory of God in their salvation, that every part of sacred Scripture, contributes to promote ity and is intended to do so. " Whatsoever things were written aforetime," says the apostle Paul, ** were written for our learning, that we, Arpugh patience and comfort of the scriptures, might liave hope ^ :" as if he had said, * Whatever things were, by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, written in the Old Testament, were left on record, •not only for the ipstruction of our ancestors, but •for ours likewise; in order that we, by means of .them, might be excited^nd encouraged to exercise patience, dnder ^11 our afflictions, and might be partakers of the joy of faith, and comfort of the

1 -

Holy Spirit, so as to attain the sure hope of grace to bear them, and of glory to crown them.' AU the types and prophesies, histories and examples^ laws and doctrines, recorded in the Scriptures, were designed to increase the consolation of believers^ under their various troubles. Accordingly, they all, in the hand of the adorable Spirit, serve, ei« ther directly or indirectly, to advance their comfort For this end, were the Old and New Testa-meats written, that they might, like breasts of consolation, be sucked by the children of God ^. The blessed word.is^ in all its parts, a magazine of comfort to the saints. Even those parts of it, which seem least adapted to afford them comfort, do, notwithstanding, promote their consolation and their delight. The strictest of its commands, prescribe to them delightful work*. The severest of its threatenings, deter them from wandering om of sncfa Ways, as are ways of pleasantness iand path? of peace. The law as a covenant, is subservieiit to the gospel, and both serve, to bring the believing soul to holy comfort ^. One commendation oi* the statutes of God, is, that ** they rejoice the heari *•." The holy word of God is, in all its parts, iiiexj>i-es-sibly sweet to the exercised Christian: it is ** the jpy and rejoicing of his heart •*.''

Believers then may assure themselves, that the all-compassionate* Saviour will) at no time, and on no oc-eounft, take away any of their comfor-ts from them, but with a view to give them better comforts. He will usually be sweetest to them, when their lot, in the world, is bitterest; for the sharper their trials are, the more will they serve, to prepare them for his sweetest consolations. If even thick clouds intercept, for a season, the cheering light of his countenance from them; those very clouds, will occasion this light to break forth again upon them, with the brighter splendor. Whether their trou-. bles be external, or internal, they, in the hand of the Holy Spirit, serve to shew them, how much they need to trust constantly and solely in the Lord Jesus, for sanctifying and supporting grace; and the more they trust in Him, the more comfort, as well as holiness, do they receive from his fulness. 6.

Were a man to possess every thing under the siin, that is de-. lightful and splendid ^ every thing, that could pleaser his eye, or gratify his taste; if he did not enjoy the favour of God with it, he should still be. poor and -wretched. To think that, the almighty Jehovah is an infinite enemy to him ; that, his temporal comforts may be followed by endless torments |» and that, by all that he cateth and drinketh, he may be but fattening for the day of slaughter; this will be as wormwood and gall, mingled with all his delights. What can it avail him^ though alt the world smile upon him, if he be under the infinite, the tremendous, frowns of almighty God? They cannot, for a moment, skreen him from the impending storm, nor secure liim from the consum- -ing fire.

Thus we see, that spiritual consolation is of h^^ importance ; because, while it is in itseU^ the gr eateU. of aQ comforts, it is that which serves to h»^tcn all other deligfats.

7. This comfint is of unspeakable importance to the saints, for it not only heightens all their other cdmforts, but it aOtviaies all iheir calamities. It makes their heaviest afflictions fight ^ When the spirit of the believer, is without comfort, the small-' est trial becomes a burthen; but when his heart is glfid, the greatest, 2q>pears light and easy ^ The Weight of an afflictvcm is to be estimated, rathef by the impression which it makes upon the spirit, than by any thii^ in its outward appeaFsnce..

So comforted, they can rejoice, and even glory, in tribulation ^. This is a plain evidence of the high importance, and excellence, of spiritual consolation, that it overcomes the pains of sense, takes out their sting, and takes off their terror. Holy comfort makes believers to defight so in all the will of God, as to take pleasure even in the hardest things, considered as his doing '. How sweet, then, must that be, which can sweeten even the wormwood and the gall! Of what consequence must that be, which can make the heaviest burthen light I Tlie delights of sense forsake ud, when we are in trouble, and liave the greatest need of them ^; but it is tAai^ that the comforts of the Spirit, have the sweetest relish, and the strongest influence^.

But spiritual consolation, ei^eciaUy when it is strong, not only alleviates, but effectually removes, that n^ost intolerable of all afflictions. When, after a dark night of desertion, the Lord graciously returneth to the disconsolate believer, and lifteth up the light of his countenance upon him; He thereby puts gladness in his heart, far sorpassing that of worldly men, when their corn and their wine increase \ By so doing, he putteth off the sackcloth of tlie exercised Christian, and girdeth him with gladness ^. No sooner doth Christ comfort tliem who mourn in Zion,. than <* he giveth unto them, beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the g^jpient of praise for the spirit of heaviness^.*' If they "have gone forth and wept, bearing precious seed;" yet no sooner doth He impart consolation to them, than " they cqme again with rejoicing, bringing their sheaves with them ^" " In his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but Joy, or shouting, cometh in the morning K" How valuable, then, how unspeak^ ably important, must Divine consolation be,, to exercised Christians; when they consider that, it is the onty, the sovereign cure, for dejection and anguish of spirit!

Not regnrding here, either the misrepresentations of some men, or the misappre-^ hensions of others, concerning the way of holiness; I shall only advert to the rAf^difficulties and gi^ie-Vances, which the Scripture itself represents, as^ occufing in that way. The Lord Jesus, that faithful and true witness, informs us, that the way to heaven, ** is a narrow way ^5" or, as the words might be rendered, a strait^ or a disiiressful way ; a way in which, the saints have to pass-through much tribulation, into tKe kingdom of God *. Beside the multitude of imaginary difficulties, which appears to the slothful man, when he says, " There is a lion in the way, a lion is in the streets ^ ;'*^ diere are some real difficulties, in the way to the heavenly felicity, Believci-s, as well as other men, are commanded to exercis^^pentance daily, and so to weep, and mourn, and loath themselves, for their iniquities ; to crucify the flesh, and so to mortify the members of the body of sin in them, which is as painful, as the cutting off of a right hand, or the plucking out of a right eye; to deny themselves, to. renounce the world as a portion, and so to abandon for ever, all the pleasures of sin ; to take up their cross,, and to lay their account with manifold afflictions; and, at the same time, to fight the good fight of faith, to wrestle against the principalities and powers of darkness, to endure hardness, to run with patience the race that is set be-

fere them, and to be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord. Now, though these, and others whichr might be mentioaed, are in themselves real diflS-cultie?, which seem very unpleasant, and from which, even eminent believers are often ready to shrink; yet^ holy comfort is more, mnch more, than sufficient to overbalance thein. It serves, in the hand of the blessed Spirit, to render wisdom's ways, notwithstanding all the difficulties and grievances^ which occur in them, " ways of pleasantness, and paths of peace,'* to the saints. Nay, so sweet, and so powerful, is spiritual consolation; that, in proportion to the degree in which it is bestowed, it makes even those painful exercises themselves, pleasant, those difficult duties, easy ■*. It renders it very pleasant to the Christian, to be without the pleasures of sin. It adds much more,^ to the pleasantness of a holy life, than it is possible for any sufferings or grievances in this worlds ^er to take from it. The sufferings are but human ; the comfort is Divine. Believers know by experience, that, in proportion as they trust in Christ, the times of their greatest affliction, are usually the seasons of their strongest consolation ^ : and, therefore, even the most dejected and sorrow-fill of them, would not, for a thousand worids, change conditions, or pleasures, with the most prosperous of those who are the servants of sin.

' know, that its sting is plucked out* But when the faith of a Christian is strongs and his hope of salvation lively,;, the joy of his faith, and the rejoicing of his hope, take away in his view, the fnghttul appearance of death, and bestow upon it,^ an amiable, an inviting aspect. Living, comforts,-in his dying moments, m^ke him even " desire, to • depart and to be with Ghrist," the blessed fountain' of everlasting, consolation p. It is the joyful hope -of a blessed resurrection, that makes the saints think without fear, of resigning their bodies to the -gloomy grave. It is the cheering prospject of " an ^ Souse not made with hands," that makes them will- -ing without dismay,, to leave their earthly taber--nacle. . When the Lord Jesus would comfort his ^ disciples, in the prospect of Jis departure from r them, he said, " I go to prepare a place for you: and if I go and prepare a place for you, I will > come agairif and receive you to myself j that where I am, there ye may be also^." If death"' were to come aloney to the saints, its ghastly coun-. tenance could not but be tenible to them ;. but ^ when they believe, and rejoice in the assurance, that their living Redeemer will, according.to his* faithful promise, come along with it, to sweeten it to them, and to conduct them safely, through the dark valley of the shadow of it', to the heavenly^ mountain of their Father's house.; the prospect is"

no longer dreadful, but delightful. How consoling are these words of the great Redeemer I He doth not say, that comfort merely will come, in that time of need; but, that He himselj\ the glorious fountain of consolation, will then come, and receive them to himself.. It is the comfort of such a promise, when believed with application, that relieves them against the dread of endless torment, and so, raises them above the. slavish fear of dying. When the 9postle Paul says, that Jesus died, he speaking, at the same time,, of believers, says, that they only deepy and sleep in Him •• One reason why he va-ries the term, is this: Jesus endured death in all its terrors; in order that, it might become a quiet and sweet deep^ to them who believe in him. " It is Christ that died '." The suffering of death, was bitter to Christ, that the sleep of death, might be sweet to them. When they, then, are enabled to rejoice in the well-grounded hope, that death to them, will only be a dissolution, a departure, a falling asleep in the arms of their dear Redeemer; the dreads of it is thereby removed. People in general, are not afraid to'lj^fcz/down in bed to sleep. Ah 1 \oyf contemptible is that pleasure, which is damped at the view of death, and chased away at the project of judgment! But how important, how excellent, that joy, which, instead of being itself abated, lessens, and even removes, the terror of that last enemy!

11. The high importance and excellence of it, will further appear, if it be compared with tfie de^ lights of sense* Earthly and sensual joy is easily.

Much more, indeed, is frequently thought and said of their value, then it deserves. They are never, from experience, found equal to the noir tion, which woridly men have of them, nor to the expectation, which they form from theak But spiritual joy, is far above the highest conceptions^ iihat either men or angels can form of it, and tlie loftiest descriptions, that they can give of iL Earthly joys too, are empty and inglorious^ e^enr the most plausiUe of them, can never fill or satisfy the soul: they are fatr below the excellence, as welt as the high capacity, of the immortal soul.

(SB THE UVfPORTANCE AND USEFULNESS^

A comfortable persuasion of the love of Jesu« tcF the souly will be operative in it, as a torch in a> sheaf: it will gradually destroy its remaining enmity against him. It will enlarge the heart with ardent love to him^ and elevate the affections above the world. The soul, in order to be kept from lusting after earthly and carnal pleasures, must, by -an appropriating faith, take pleasure in the Savl* our, and in his love. Holy comfort imbitters sin to a man, and djsposes him, with deep abhorrence of it, to strive against it. It tends greatly to melt, and to humble the heart for sin ^, The firmer a holy man's comfort is, the softer his heart is. The more ^* his heart is fixed, trusting ip the Lord, so as not to be afraid of, evil tidings;"' the more disposed he is, to fear the evil of sinning against him *.

. Spiritual comfort also, inclines and encourages^ the saints, ardently to follow after universal holi'-ness of life^ and constantly to long for the per--fection of it. ." The Spirit of the Lord God," saith Messiah, f^ is upon me, because the Lord hath anointed mcj.^.to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called Trfes of righ^ teousness, The planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified *." It disposes believers, to frequency and impartiality in self-examination ^ ; and excites them, to diligent endeavours after increasing

communion with God, in every duty '. It is employed by the Holy Spirit, to render them active, resolute, and checrlul, in the spiritual performance rf all their various duties**. Godly sorrow, in--deed, disposes them to be serious; but it is holy joy, that renders them active: it is ^' the oil 6f •glftciliess," that makes the wheels of their voluntary obedience, move forward with ease and speed. Some measure of holy comfort, is necessary to the practice of evangelical holiness. Summer, in the natural world, is necessary as well as winter. The very nature of the duties and exercises of the true Christian, is such, that they require comfort of 'heart, for the acceptable performance of them. A holy life commonly begins with comfort, and is -maintained by it^ The way to be kept frotn carelessness and formality, in spiritual exercises, is, so to trust in Christ for salvation, as to cease to despond; for the soul grows careless by desponding. The* sorrow of the world, and the fear of hell, eri-•ervate and benumb all the faculties of the soul. A man can perform no spiritual obedience, without some degree of spiritual joy, as well as of true love. The former, is as much the fruit of the Spirit, as the latter ^. The Christian cannot be encouraged to pray to God; except he be consoled with the hope, that God, for Christ's sake, will graciously hear and answer his prayer ^, He cannot cordially praise God; unless he be enabled to trust, that 'God will glorify the perfections of his nature, «nd

'70 THE IMPORTANCE AND USEFULNESS

xnagnify the promises of his cevenant, in his eternal salvation. It is in proportion as his heart is comforted, that he will be truly thankful to the Lord, for the smallest favour. It is holy consolation, that makes every act of .grace, every instance -of duty, ev^ry part of spiritual service, how secret fioever it be, pleasant to a good man. In a i^ord, it is this, that so exhilarates, and so constrams faim, as to make aJl his affection run out to the JLord Jesus, and aH his -strength run outj^ him.

So much, for the importance and usefiilness of ^piritnal comfort, to every -believer.

From what has been here advanced, we mayin-fa'. That no comforts are so excellenty so sweety and ^ desirable^ as spirittud comforts. While these form . a part of eternal life, and promotie, in an eminent degree, the love and practice x>f holiness; they are the same in kind, as the dedights of holy angels, and of ransomed spirits ki the holy place on h^h* They are the pleasures oS a holy sonl, and ihciy heighten the relish of every outward comfort. The light of God's gracious countenance, shinic^ upon the Boul, is better than life, and all its most valued enjoyments. If an Israelite was to be out off from his people, who had in his house, a perfume like that of the Tabernacle ^ j surely, the Lord will not hold him guiltless, who persuades himself, that any other perfume can be so fragrant, so delightful, as that of the house of God 9 that any other joy c^n be so excellent, so ennobling, so cheering, as the joy of God's salvation.

Is ^ritual ;|oy, of such h^h importance to the %€>}kie«-and bappmess of the saints, in this world, where it is fer froai being perfect ? How highly then *wiU it contnbute to theu'felicity^ in theheavt7tly iBBorM, ^ere it shall, through all eternity, be fuU imd overflowing! O how transcendently great, liow kite^essibly: glorious, will the holiness and Uedsedness of die redeemed, in the immediate, prer «eBce of God and of the Lamb, be; where they chaU attliin '^ fdbess of joy," and perhaps, an etev'-nal increase of raptu^us ddUight! If spiritual con« solatieto, even when it is smaU, impels believers to jmweaiied «flbrt»^ in holy worship and ^uritual obedience; we n^ed not winder, that the four liv-kig creatures, round abc^t the throne, are represented, in the visions of John, as not resting day iand night, as never ceasing to thank and praise the Lord; " saying. Holy, holy, holy, Lord God ai-jni^ty, who was, and is, and is to corned" ^f even a small ineasuire of pure consolation, is of such advantage to a holy man, nlow, as to encourage liis heart, to invigorate his grace, to excite his hdiy activity, and to heighten all his outward comforts ; of what unspeakable gain to him, hereafter, BhaQ the fukiess <^joy9 the perfection of endless delight be!

Is holy consolaticHi, of such ineisdmable value to the spiritual seed of Christ, that He, in the immensity of his love, came down from the realms of light, to purchaise it for them ? Believers may learn from this, what infinite obligations they are under, to Aeir incarnate Eedeemer. Christian, thy dear

' EOV. IT. 8.

^^ The importance and usefulness

Saviour hatfa, at tde infinite expense of liis 6wh unparalleled obedience, anguish, and death, purchased and secured everlasting consolation for thee. He was troubled in spirit, that thou mightst be comforted: He was encompassed with the sorrows of eternal death, that thou mightst enter into the jojrs of everlasting life: He was arrayed in the spirit of heaviness, that thou mightst be clothed with ** the garment of praise:" He, who was, from etemt-ty, the delight of his Father, ** rejoicing always before Him,'' endured for thee, the hiding of his countenance, and the sense of his infinite wrath, that thou mightst, to eternity, joy in God through hini. Hath he not done and suffered enough, to shew thee, that he is willing to enrich thee with consolation, that he careth for thy ccmifort, and that he giveth thee sufficient cause to be always of good comfort ? Were it not, that there is something in thy heart, which requires the discipline of his covenant; he taketh such pleasure in comforting thee, that thou couldst, at no time, be disconsolate. Thou art therefore infinitely bound, to love Him ardently and supremely, to glory in his cross, and to delight in doing his will.

From what has been said, we may also learn that. In proportion as a man makes Christ and holiness his choice^ he will find them to be his de* light The more communion with Jesus Christ, and the more conformity to Him, he desires and attains; the more delight in him, and in God through him, shall he experience. The more his heart is set upon growing in holiness, and the more willingly and resolutely^ he performs all his duties,

Tor the glory of his God and Redeemer j the more shall he know by elperience, ttiat the ipotnforts of religion overbalance ttie difficulties of it In proportion as he takes pleasure in spiritual exercises, And holy performances, and that from love to Christ, and for the glory of God j the most labori* 6us exercises of religion shall become pleasant to him, and the most dMicuIt duties,* easy. Holy consolation, in-the hand of the blessed Spirit, makes €oery thing in holinessj a pleasure to him; and the closer Jhe walketh with God, the God of all comfort, the stronger and sweeter is hisxonsolation.

If spiritual comfort is of such importance and utility to believers, as hath been shewn; surely, k is the duty of every believer, to use diligentlj/^ the appointed means of attaining a gi'adual increase of it The apostle Paul exhorted the believers in Corinth, to," be of good comfort ^ 5" that is, to be so di^rrent in receiving, by the frequenl exercise of faith, the conrfort offered and promised to them in the gospel, as to attain more and more of the joy of faith, and of a good conscience. Nothing will carry a Christian tlirough the inward and outward difficulties of religion, but the inward supports and delights of it. Every believer, thei-efore, should constantly endeavour to attiain, as early as possible, mitch of the comfort of the Holy Spirit; that he may, the more easily and Aeerfullv, surmount every difficulty, and -be the more resolute in the practice of universal holiness. . The hypocrite will not ** always call upon God,'' because he ^'ill net " det^ybimseK in the Ahnighty*." Were

te to delight himself in the Almighty, especially 4is a God infinitely holy; he would no longer be ^ liypocrite, and would always call upon Him. If the true believer would, at all times, persevere in spiritual, and cheerful obedience to the comnaand-ments of Christ; he -must, in the strength of pro* mised grace, labour to attain more and more ^ the com&rt of communion with Him in bis righteous* ness and fulness: for, ihe more his heart is com&Ft* «d, the more ^^ he is established in every^ood word and work "^/' He hath always need of ^spiritmd comfort, in this vaUey of tears, to 4»t£engthe8i bim jbr his spiritual conflicts, and holy perfar^oaances^ and therefore, under an abiding sense of his need of it, he should daily employ the means of receiving fresh supplies.

Once more: Is holy consolation, of such conse--quence to the saints ? Hence it is evident, that their loss of it, must be a very great and grievous loss to them. 'Die loss, indeed, of lively and plea* sant feelings, though a grievous, yet is not usually a very great loss to the exercised Christian j but the loss of that ardinaiy comfort or tranquillity of mind which he has hitherto enjoyed, is both a very great, and a very grievous loss to him. He may, for a season, be without sensible and lively impressions, and yet not be deserted of God, in respect of habitual comfort, or serenity of mind. For, as it is not a cloud intervening, nor even a partial ^ipse of the sun, but the absence of the sun, that occasions night \ so, it is not the want of a lively Impi^essiop^ or a pleasant &ame^ bub, the loss of

At the same time, it is not for every sin of infirmity, that he suspends consoling influences from their souls; otherwise, as they can never so much as think a thought, without pollut-11^ it by <K>me degree of sin, he would, at aU times, be afflicting them with want of comfort; but, it is for some peculiarly aggravated transgressions, or, for relapsing often into the same sin.

Ail that, in this Chapter, I further propose to do, is, to point out some of the leading sins and ways of sinning, by which, believers provoke their lieavenly Father to suspend for a time, that degree: of holy consolation from them, which they have formerly enjoyed.

1^ In the first place. They provoke him to do tl&ift, by allowing themselves to continue, iu a culpable degree, ignorant of his covenant of grace ^ and of their warrant to come, as sinners, and to trust in the Lord- Jesus, for their own particular salvation. These are objects in which, the comfort of true be-: lievers, is at all times, intimately concerned; the spiritual and distinct knowledge of which, is necessary to qualify them, for deriving continual supplies of grace and consolation, from the fulness of Christ ^

If believers then suffer themselves, surrounded. as they are, by the clear light of the blessed gospel,^ to retain ignorance, or to cherish mistakes, respect- -ing the covenant of JehoyMs peace ", and the in-' finite fulness and freeness of his^rac^ treasured up' in Christ, the glorious Trustee of that covenant $ they do thereby undervalue the only doctrine, on^

Were believers to attain a more spiritual, and clear, understanding of the eternal covenant^^^ and of the authentic offer of it, than they com-monly do; they would see that they have, in the word of grace without them, a Rill and unchanged-able vrarrant, to trust at all times in the Lord liBBUSi, for their own particular salvation ; and so, iSuy W4Mild live a more holy and comforlable life, ■ than they -commonly do ^.

The consequence is, that the believer now, not only discerns no grace in his heait^ to trust to, but begins to doubt if ever he had any. He formerly looked for comfort, to the principle o{ grace, which he discerned in himself, rather than to the fulness of grace, which is in Christ j contrary to this high command, ** Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Jesus Christ */* But now, that'he can see and feel nothing in his heart, but deep and strong corruption, nothing but a body of sin and death, he becomes at once, dis« couraged and disconsolate.

" For the iniquity of his covetous^-ne&s^' saith Jehovah, ** was I wroth and smote him; I hid me and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the way. of his heart °.'' The inordinate and immoderate love of any temporal benefit, doth, upon the loss of that benefit, commonly pro-, duoe discontent, impatience, and fretfulness, which have a natural tendency to wear down the spirit. Were the Christian to bear his loss of outward comforts, in the exercise of faith, and of resignation to the holy will of God, he should still continue to experience inward "consolation. But when he pre* sumes to fret and murmur, as if the Lord had wronged him, or had been unkind to him \ saying, * Alas! My afflictions are very uncommon, are peculiarly severe;' he thereby procures for himself, in addition to his outward losses, the loss of inward consolation. Such a behaviour as this, forms a combination of various sins, all of which, are inconceivably heinous, and exceeding sinful.

by the Kvely exercise of the contrary graces, he" may resist them without delay: for if be do not, in such a case, instantly try to exercise his graces, and e^)ecialiy his faith ; Satan, who is always envious and watchful, will seize tliat opportunity, to exercise his corruptions: and if, by being negligent-to watch and resist the first motions of corruption' in his heart, he suffer them often to obtain such-force, as to gain the consent of his will to actual* transgression; he can have none to blame but him* self, for the loss of his holy consolation K

Seeing the remaining depravity of the heart, ia* not only itself, a source of temptation to actual sin"^, but is the inlet for all temptations from Satan and the world ^ ; the believer, if he would retain spiritual consolation, must Ukewise be ever. upon his guard, against temptations from wUhoiut.

ternal chastisements, are four: and it is remarka-•ble, that he employs three of them, to express the emission of ^uties^ and but one, to express the direct commission of sins.—** If his children forsahe ftiy law, and walk not in my judgments; if thejr breaks or, profane my statutes, and kmpfwtvuy^w&L^ jnandments; then will I visit their transgression wkh the rod, and their iniquity with stripes**/* 'Though sins df commission do, indeed, exp^ise b^ Kevers to fatherly chastisements; yet, I believe it witl be found, that sins <^ omissi^im do it much more frequently: because they are iaftener guiltjr 'of these, and they yield to them, with less struggte and remorse, than they do, to sins cif commission. The spiritual declension of a Christian, especially at its beginning, discovers itself, for the most pari, more by the customary omission of some -duties^ than by the positive commission of crimes'^. For, although the omission of a piiesent duty, is indeed a sin ; yet, it doth not usualJy appear to a declining Christian, at first view, to be so horrible, as the direct commission of a known transgression. And therefore nothing commonly, bnt some violent and strong temptation can, at first, impel him to the downright perpetration of a crimen whereas, a very small temptation will often suffice, to move him to the neglect of an ordinance, or the omission of a dnty. If he should happen to be, at any time, fatigued more than usually ; or, to be mider a vtvy i-light "bodily distemper j or, to have' less time, or less accommodation, than usual; or, to be ditsturbed^ and ruffled in his temper j or, to be receivkig of

Aad having onoe began to admit su<^ frivolous excuses, he may,, fetbapsj be {permitted far a season, to offer to 'his 6HHSctence, almost any sort of occurrence, as an «Bcase ibr oarittiog the stated performance of one 4Hr other of these duties. -On «udi occasions, be ismmooly nep^eots likewise the exercise of his gcaces, especiafiy, ef ius faith and repentance; and, it may be, takes occasion, either fiom his jsins or from Ibs duties, to do so. Or, perhaps, he suffers faimself to n^eglect for a season, some relative duty ^, 0r at least, to perform it not " heartily, as imto the Lord ^.^ Now, inasmuch as every omission 'of known duty, is a sin against God ^; the Qiris-tian, by ailoiving himself ibr a season, often to neglect some known duty, or not to perform it cbeer<ii fillly *, grieves the Holy Spirit of God^ and provokes Him to suspend consolation from his soul. When he thus presumes to make the Spirit sad, he must not expect, that the Spirit will continue, as formerly, to make him glad. The moment, his heart withdraws and hangs ofl* from any present duty, as if it were an unpleasant or irksome task, it does in the same proportion, withdraw from the Lord ; and so, it loses the comfort of serving Him, as well as of conununion with him ^. To resolve

* Fph. vi. 2, 3. 1 Tim. v. 8. ^ Col. iii. 23.

* James iv. 17. ' Mai. i, 13, 14. ^ John xiv, 21.

to omit a present duty, is even nfore sinfiil) {has actually to omit it, without intending so to do ^; Ah ! how heinous a sin is it, to be disposed, and without necessity, to be resolved, either tb omit or to curtail, a single religious or moral duty ! It sh^ws how Httle regard, a man has, to the glorious Majesty of heaven, when ^e can put Him offj witH slight and curtailed service ^* Such behaviour il tiiis, will soon, very soon, raise such a thick add dark cloud, as will intercept the cheering beams' of the Sun of righteousness, from the soul. Alas 4 the omission, or slight performance of many duties, is far from being considered and lamented, by true Christians, as it ought to be.

I have already said that, a believer loses his comfort, by omitting repeatedly, and without necessity, some known duty: I must now go further, and add that. If he live for a long tim£V HI the omission of some duty^ which he doth not yet kncm to be a duty ; but, which he might have known to have been required of him, if he had diligently availed himsdf of his opportunities to know it;—this instance of neglect may lie concealed, as a gnawing worm, at the root of his comfort. His neglecting the study of the moral law, in its spirituality and great extent, as his rule of duty ^, so as to continue ignorant of his duty, in any one point; is, when opportunity is

graciously afforded him, for attaining this know-

When a good man so &r forgets liimself, as to rest satisfied for a time, with his present degree of knowledge, or faith, or holi-nesB, and to become remiss in his efibrts to attain more and more of these; when he begins and continues, to be «o well pleased with his d^ree of knowledge, as to read and hear the gospel, with Jess rdish and less diligence, than formerly; to be so delighted with his measure of faith and experience, as neither to complain so much of his unbelief nor to be so diligent and frequent in his f.ctings of foith, as in times past; and, to beso fpnd of his attainments in holiness, as to be less diligent than formerly^ in pressing toward perfec-Ipon; he may assure himself, that he shall thereby lose tlie comfort of communion with a holy and a jealous God. If he accustom himself for a season, not only, so to rest in his religious attain-: ments, as to be less eager in pursuing after higher degrees of holiness^ but, to rest on them, or place his confidence in them; he a(1o)>ts hereby, the surest method of losing at once, the sight and the comfort of them '.

Thi» IB otie snre Way, in which, he provides the LorA to hide his gracious countenanee from him, and io cover his eridjences widi a cloud in his ai^er\ Spiritual comforts if they be Tested on, shall, as effectually as earthly cmes, keep a man from com-. fortable communion with Christ. When the Lord Jesus vouchsafes to him, the comfort of^irituai attainments, it is not that he may live upon itf but, that he may be incited and encouraged by it,^ lo persevere in holy faith and evangelical obedi-^^Hce. But if he, on the contrary, idlow himself to be elated with his attainments or comforts, and, like H«zekiah, invite others to see his treasures $ then, it will be time for the Lord, to send the messengers of his anger, to carry away from his view these idols, which steal away his heart from Htm. When his heart is swelling with self-importance, and self-confidence, all that is then poured on 4t, runs over into the gulf of self-conceit, Mid sel&suffieiency.

Were tlley duly concerned dit •the welfare of their souls, they would frequently j*efresh them, by exercising holy meditation and iaith; as they do their bodies, by receiving food, thrice or oftener in the day. Diligence in holy exercises and moral duties, is not only a debt to the Lord, but a privilege to believers themselves: and therefore by being slothful, they discover at •once injustice and unkindness; a contempt of the ll^Iorieus Majesty of heaven, and a neglect of his redeeming mercy. When the Saviour draweth near, and they regard it not; when He knocketh, and they open not; it is indeed high time that) :by -withholding tlie comfort of his gracious visits, from them, he should chastise their negligence, and •rouse them to diligence"*. It is equitable, as well ^s reasonable, that the consequence of spiritual sloth should be, a loss of sensible consolation. 'Accordingly, in the administration of the covenant of grace, an intimate connection is established, between diligence in' holy duties, and'the fruition of .spiritsal comforts. The indol^t Christian cannot (retain tranquillity of mind °. What heavenly consolation must he lose, for instance, by his crimin* al inattention to the precious promises of God, and ^ven to the daily dispensations of his holy provi* ^ence, to him 1 If his love, which was once an ascending flame, become a feeble spark; if his penitential sorrow^ whijCb once, like Jordan, over-* £owed all its banks, become ^' like a brook in smn-(ttier;" if his zeal, which formerly did eat him upt be devoured by leanness or declension; if he who,-

in times past, could not " give sleep to his eyes nor slumber to his eye-lids," tiJl Jesus gave rest to his soul, can lie down securely, with contracted guilt in his conscience; and if he, who formerly was diligent in spiritual exercise and holy obedi<' ence, become remiss and regardless j he thereby makes a wide breach, for the entrance of spiritual trouble ®. It is indeed mercifully, as well as wisely, appointed, that when he becomes indolent, his comfort should decline; in order that he may perceive in time, that he is in a languishing condi-^ tion, and may without delay, entreat the Lord Jesus to restore his soul. Besides, if the Lord did-not, on such occasions, withdraw himself, the Christian would not prize his gracious presence ^'j^ly^ nor think it so comfortable, as it is. Be« Iiever, <' be not then slothful in business; but be fer* vent in spirit, serving the Lord p." See that, by grace received daily from the fulness of Christ, thjr soul be vigorous and active in his holy service '• Be always diluent, in attempting the exercise of grace^ in using the means of grace, and in doing every good work, in the strength of promised grace. If persons linger on a journey, they are sometimes benighted; if thou become slothful, in exercising^ thy gracfes, or in performing thy duties; wonder not, if thou begin to walk in darkness. Be continually on thy guard, then, against every appear-anccjUf inward declension, and especially, against slothftilness in the exevn^? of direct confidence in Christ, and of secret prayer.

11. Believers sutler a diminution of their spiritual forolbrt, by having and entertaining, a law estima^ Hon of the counsels and comforts of the Holy Spirit rf Christ. When they allow themselves, for a season, to entertain a light esteem of the counsels, or ordinances, or promises, or influences, or comforts, of the blessed Spirit; when they receive these, but not gratefully, or keep them, but not diUgently; &ey thereby dishonour and grieve the Holy Spirit himself, who is the glorious Author of them. An earthly Sovereign would account himself dishonoured, if his proclamations, or pardons, or favours, ^ould not be entertained with high regard, eiq>eci-ally by those, who are not only the subjects of his dominion, but the objects of his favour. In like manner, if they, who are the subjecis of the Spirit's gracious influences, and the objects of his peculiar liivour, do not account his word their treasure, his promises their joy, his Sabbatlis their delight, and his consolations, their felicity; they so far treat 'Himself with indignity: and the more exalted a^ glorious, the adorable Spirit is, the more sinful, the indignity is, which is thereby offered him. Be^ sides, if, in their practical judgment, they prefer mean and even sinful objects, before the great things of the Spirit ^ such as, the wisdom and the maxims of the world, before His counsels j the comforts and the pleasures of the world, before His consolations; the riches and the honours of the world, before the honour of holy conformity to Him, and of intimate communion with him; they do thereby, offer an infinite affront to his glorious Majesty. For, what greater dishonour can tliey reject upon the holy and blessed Spirit, than prac-

ticidlj, to shew greater regard to a creature^ to a,'-rata creature, yea, to an enemy, than to Him! Ah ! when a Christian's desire to the food of hift soul, is almost gone; when he appears, as if he ha4 been surfeited with the gospel; when Divine ordinances, instead of being highly esteemed, are basely slighted by him; and when his heart is •more set upon his farm or merchandise, than upon iseasons of communion with God in Christ; he Baust not be surprised, if he should, for a season, •be taught the worth of these inestimable blessings^ "by the want of them. Or when, by poring constantly upon the sins of his heart, and of his life^ «nd by setting the demerit of these, as it were, in battle-array, against the merit of the great R^ 4eeiiier*8 consummate righteousness, he makes lit-•de accoiuit of the offers and promises of the bless-4jd gospel; he must blame none but himself, for bis loss of comfort. O Christian, consider well^ 'tliese words of the apostle Paul:— *' To be spirifr -wlly minded is life and2>eace ^* Endeavour to at>-tain without delay, a more spiritual and clear dich cernment of the things of tiie Spirit. Pray frequently and fervently, for more acquaintance with tbem, and for more complacency in them. Lcam to form such a low estimate of the creature, as to expect nothing from it; and such a high esteem of -the Lord" Jeitus, as to expect all from Him: so afaalt thou be exempted from those-frequent, and galling disappointments, which cannot but render the life of a believer uncomfortable '.

12. True Christians deprive themselves of con>-foTtyhy preswning to pray for things ^ xvhick are not' suUable to their condition^ and which, it would not be consistent with the scheme of their salvation, to grant them at present, nor indeed at any time. When they venture repeatedly to ask in prayer, something which the Lord seeth to be improper -for them, and not necessary to subserve the wise purposes of his glory, in their sanctification; *' They ask, and receive not, because they ask a-miss "." If, for instance, they pray that, as much grace might be given them at once, as would be sufficient for them all their life-time "^ ; if they peremptorily ask sensible manifestations, great en* largements, and high extaeies of joy ; if they pray &r any comfort whatever, without resolving to use diligently, atl the other appointed means of attaii> ing it; if they entreat the removal of any affliction^ before they have been rightly exercised under it *; and, if they pray absolutely for a certain measure^ of tlie good things of this life;—the Lord will not,-and indeed cannot, in mercy to them, grant such petitions* The consequence often is, that after }ia\ing, it may be, waited long for answers without receiving any, they become discouraged and disconsolate. MoreoveF, when they venture iu sprayer, to prescribe to the Lord, a *voay and a time

oTappoaring for their help; and when the Lord^ n be will surely do, refuseth to come for their salvation, in that particular way, and at tliat very lime' ; they take occasion from that refiii»al, to yield to disquietude and discouragement: or, when they venture to propose the Lord's particular way of treating some other believers, as the way in which, they dcsii*e that he would deal with them; Mid find that, tiicy^are not gratified likewise in this ; they, somctimesj begin to yield to discouraging and desponding thoughts. Thus, they pre-sume to limit the holy One of Israel, who hath re--solved to act as an infinite Sovereign, in his ma!>- * ncr ofbnngiugall his saints to glory. Believers,-it* tiiey would retain spiritual consolation, would do well to consider, that it is only such petitions, as are for tilings unnecessary, and even hurtful to them, that the LoihI refuseth to grants that he never denieth any of them, without a sufficient red-scyn, and that he sometimes condescends to shew them the reason^) that he never refuseth, but when they ask what is not good, or rather, what is not best (or them,^ at the time referred to; and, that althougb they do not receive what they come for, yet he allows them, that which is sufiicient to bear their charges in coming and g^ing, and invites them to come again. They ought also to 4»nsider, .that those arenot^the holiest, nor the greatest of believers, whose sense is the most in^ dulged^ Believing Mary, is forbidden to touch Jeans; and disbelieving Thomas, is commanded to thrust his hand into his 8id«.

13»- They procure for themselves, the loss of holy comfort, by yielding for a season, to such tempta^ tioDS, as urge them to attempt things in religion^ thcU are impracticable. When Satan perceives that he cannot persuade the Christian, especially the young and unexperienced Christian, to live in the neglect of any known duty; he, sometimes, presses him vehemently, to a rash and quick peribrmance of some difficult duty. He suggests to him, that the Lord is a hard Master; tliat he deligbteth in requiring difficult duties, duties too, which must be performed speedily, and that, on the pain of incurring his infinite displeasure; that, like a ty-jannical ruler, who makes laws in order to ensnare hiis subjects, he commands duties which are oppressive, and doth it with unrelenting rigour; and that, he requires them to be done with the utmost degree of exactness, or else he wiH not accept diem.^ Now, so far as a good maa yidds to this horrible temptation, he presumes to imagine, dut the com-ttaddmenta of Ck)d axe grievous^, that the yoke f£

* James iv. 3» ^ Epli. iii. 20r

Ghrist is hard. Apprehending the Lord Jesug to be a rigorous Master, he, under the prevalence of *.^vish fear ^, perforins even the easiest of his dur ties, without courage, without affection, and even with aversion. His comfort accordingly is destroy^ ed, his heart is dgected, his hands are weakened.

Moreover, Satan sometimes urges him, to at* tempt the doing of several things at once^ which he well knows is impossible. And the moment he yields to this temptation, his heart begins to be so divided, his thoughts to be so perplexed, and hi3 attention to be so distracted, between a multiplicity of objects wliich crowd into his view, that h^ becomes incapable of performing any duty well. Endeavouring to grasp too much, he lets all slip* Whatever he tries to perform, he does it superfl" ciaiHj and unseasonably. When he is called to perform one duty, he is, perhaps, addressing himself to another; and, like Martha, he is ^< careful and troubled about many things ^J* The great rule of every duty is this j—" Whatsoever thy hand find-«th to do, do it with thy might * ;" that is, * Let thy heart be wholly intent upon, and occupied with that one duty, while thou art performing it' Indeed, it cannot otherwise be performed, either ao-Mptably or comfortably.

The tempter alio will, sometimes, instigate those 4>f 4h^ saints, who are called to pei^form a greater rariety of duties than others are, to continue long-mrtbaD is requisite, in doing some one duty; in mrder to put it out of their power, rightly to dis« jdiarge some otber^ equally incumbent on thenik

He will press them, for instance, either to emplby so much time in the worship of the family, and ^^ pecially, in that of the closet, as to have no op^ 'portunity for some other duty equally necessary; or to spend so much time, in some duty respecting their secular affairs, as to have almost no oppor^ tunity for those holy and necessary exercises. In prop|)ttk>n as a good man yields for a time, t6 this temptation ; it is easy to see that, he thereby deprives liimself of that comfort of communion with a holy God, which is enjoyed only, in a conscientious and seasonable discharge of every kno^n duty. Now, in order to prevent hrs falling into this destructive snare, he ought daily to trust, as "well as to pray, that the Lord Jesus, who is given ** for a leader to the people *^," would according . ^ to his promise ^, guide him continually to that •which, in preference to every other, is his present duty. And when he discerns his present duty, he should resolutely, and in the faith of the promise, dispatch that, and then proceed, in the same man«-iier, to his next duty. Let htm diligently perforna every act of obedience, in its proper season ; and, that he may have opportunity for every one, let trim sa redeem his time, as to spend no time in idle«-ness, or in doing any thing but that which his con^ science pronounces to be his present duty \

14. Believers forfeit the continuance of their spi^ "ritual comfort, by the commission of gross, and atrocious transgressions; of such sins^ as are ifon*-trary, not only to the light of Revelation, but e^en io the light of nature. By doing so, they r€bel

l^iiist) and ** vex the Holy iSpirit» so that he is turned,*' as it were, ** to be their enemy, and to fight against them K" By such iniquities, they at the same time, wound and waste their own coti-^ sciences. When a holy man presumes to resem-^ ble the men of this world so much, as to commit but one of the sins mentioned in 1 Cor. vi. 9, 10.^ or any other heinous iniquity; he thereby pierces the Lord Jesus, grieves the Holy Spirit, inflicts a de^ wound in his own conscience; and so pro* cures for himself, the loss of holy consolation. We see, in some of the penitential Psalms of Da« vid, that his adultery and murder, not only deprived him of sensible comfort; but exi^oscd him, and that for a long season, to Divine desertion, in respect even of quickening and purifying influences, •We know also, that l^eter's denial of his blessed 'Lord, rendered him, for a time, very disconsolate; If a good man, then, instigated either by corruption within, or by temptation from without, suffer himself, not only to contemplate with desire, but ac« tually to fall into, any of those enormities which^ by one apostle, are termed, ^^ The works of the flesh *," and by another, " The pollutions of the world * $" he exposes himself, in an uncommon d^ree, to the dreadful frowns of his heavenly Fa« ther: for such enormities, as they are directly op« posite even to the light of nature, so they are most (contrary to the influences of grace. The sin of a believer in falMng into any one of them, is deeply Aggravated fmn all his manifold privileges, and more especially from this; that he usually has

16, Lastly, Bdlever^ procare for tbeirtselvcs the loes of holy comfort, by rchpsing often into the same sin, Wh-t sin soerer it be, and bow btrong. soevw the temptation to it be; the repeated, and' especially, xhejrrq:i£iif comnission erf it, wiiJ pro Toke the Ho!y Spirit, to wiihhold his.consoiing influences from the backsliding Christian.

By Ins daring to do so^ he " maketh Christ the minister of sin**:" lie: practically represents the holy Jesus and his great, salvation, as leaving him still under the dominion of sin, yea, as afiording him encouragement to practise iniquity. Besides, by relapsing often into the same transgression, the Christian practically declares, tliat he still loves, and has^ {Measure in that sin. Now, by loving tliat vdiich is inexpres^ sibly hateful, and which the Lord hateth with ioi-finite abhorrence j and by. counting that pleasant, to his taste, virhich is of all things the most bitter, and which tendered to the Saviour's lips, the vino^* gar and gall; the believer renders^ it indiqiensably necessary, that the sweet and holy consolations of the l^irit, be suspended.from him; in order that, Jie may be mad« to see, that his iniquity is most batefui, and to experience, that it is most bitter*

PJenli. 19^ tCai^ii. n.

Moreover, the repetition of a transgression heigh* lens the crime. As, in figures, the addition of one Sgure, makes the number ten times greater; so he Christian's repetition of the same sin, of a sin jrhich he has often confessed, lainented, and revived against; renders it heinous in a tenfold decree, and calls aloud for paternal chastisement. [n such a case, he must be taught, not only by he anguish of the Redeemer's soul, in the garden ind on the cross, but by the trouble of his own pirit, that sin is of all evils the greatest; and that lis having fallen again and again^ into* the same ifience, after he had received, the forgiveness )f sins, renders his sin exceeding sinful ^. And if, after he has, for Ihs disobedience, been cha^ teoed with outward affliction, he, nevertheless, turns again to the same offence ; this will, if in-inlte mercy prevent it not, inevitably expose him o inward distress, which is inexpressibly more Ureadftil and intolerable. Ah ! when a man, who lath believed through grace, presumes to cast a >ropitious eye upop some easily besetting sin, and jecretly to say, " Is it not a little one ? and my loul shall live;" he is not aware, how effectually, he hereby robs his soul of holy comfort. If, after laving often complained to the Lord, of his unbe-icf, pride, self-confidence, deadness, frowardness, xjnsoriousness, and other evils; he still is ready, m almost every occasion, to gratify, if not to ex* mse and vindicate them j does he not hereby re* remble the hj'pocrite ? and is it not proper, that he khould for a season, be deprived of the comfort of

' Ezra Lv. 13,14. Mai ii. 1-3.

seeing, tbat he is a sincere believer; and also, thiat Ke should be left under the prevalence of perplexing fears, that he has hitherto been, and at pre^nt is,^ but a hypocrite? I do not say, tbat a man's relfq)&* ing for a time, again and again into the same transgression, proves him to be a hypocrite; for Ood hath nowhere promised such a degree of strength, to his people, during their state of imperfec^on, a» will set them beyond the possibility of relapsing for a season, into the same offence *: but I affirm, that a true Christian's doing so, makes him.i^pear very like a hj^ocrite, obscures bis evidences of sincerity, renders his condition inexpressibly dreadfiily and exposes him to a very severe chastisement* Believer, if this be thy present condition, O apply, and without delay plead, this gracious promise, <^ I will heal their backslidii\g, I will love them freely *;" and, in the faitli of it, watch and strive with holy resolution, especially against <^ the m^ which doth so easily beset thee." Know, tbat tbj redeeming God hath made an unalterable, an eternal separation, between the love of sin, and the joy of salvation. O endeavour diligently, to become eminent, especially in that grace, which is more immediately the opposite of thy constituticHial sin. Wouldst thou wish to keep down doubts and fears, and to keep up faith and comfort ? Shun, O shun every occasion, and every appearance, especially of that sin **. Be persuaded that, the* pleasure of overcoming, even the most easily besetting sin, is inconceivably greater, than the pleasure of commitr tuig it.

From the foregoing particulars, the disconsolate

i)eliever may plainly see, that he has none to blame

hii himself, for his loss of holy consolation. When

he IB bewailing his want of peaceful tranquillity, or

of hojy joy, he must complain o{ none but himselE

It is he himself that takes, and even forcei^ a^

way, his own comfort: for, by his aggravated sins,

he bath rendered it necessary, that the Lord should

bide his face from him. Indeed, he never sins a-

gainst God, without sinning, at the same time, a-

gainst his own souL We read in the Scriptures^

.That we must forgive our enemies, but never in

express terms. That we must forgive— our Jriends.

The iniquities of God's own people^ are the most

provoking to him: and though he hath forgiven

tliem all, as to the guilt of eternal wrath; yet, as

m the case of Moses, he may refuse to forgive some

of them, in respect of the guilt of paternal anger,

- The iniquity of others, " is marked before him ;'*

but ** the sin of Judah, is written with a pen of

iron, and with the point of a diamond ^.'' The

friends of Christ, then, must be ever on their guard

against sin, especially against wilful sin. Sinning

wilfully, will assuredly weaken their hands, and

bring trouble into their consciences.

Does a good man forfeit his holy comfort, by making his graces, or performances, or lively frames, his ground of right to trust in Jesus for salvation ? He should hence learn the need that he has, to be daily exercising himself in moriifi/^ • ing the legal spirit, which remains in him. It is thiSf that prompts him to make his graces and dur

* Jer. xvii. 1*

ties, his warrant to renew his actings of trust inr the Saviour , and thereby, to forfeit the comfort of his souL Next to unbelief itself, his legal temper is, perhaps, the worst enemy of his pure consola-^ tion. It is a secret and subtle foe, that seems to intend him a kindness; whilst it is always putting him, upon seeking for some good qualifications in himself, on the ground of which, he may trust that God loveth him, and that Christ saveth him^ Let him, therefore, if he would retain spiritual comfort, be diligent in mortifying his self-righteous spirit; and know that, the way to conquer and destroy it, is, by faith, to bring daily into his consci* ence a better hope, from a better righteousness than that of the law. All the spiritual distress of the -exercised Christian, may be traced to a legal spirit in him. He seldom wants comfort, but by looking less or more to his own nghteousness, ia* stead of looking off, to the consummate righteousnefli of Jesus Christ ^ ''. Believer, it is not sufficient, in

^^ The Author of an excellent Sermon, in pointing ..out some of the injuries which believers sustain, bj the prevalence of the legal temper, expresses himself thu*: ■—* It spoils them of their comfort, and brings a damp of sorrow and dejection, over their spirits. None have such ground of comfort as believers; and did they know Jiow to improve thtir privilege; did tlicy live daily la the faith of the gospel, and in the comforts of theii ne>f state, they would be the most cheerful pei-sons in the world: but the pi'evalence of this temper, like a moth, secretly worms out the very life of their comfoK, and throws them into the depths of despondency. Wliat comfort can they have, in tiie duties of religion, when ti^ey seek it from themselves, ard from their duties? What comfort can they have^ either in duty, or out cf ^////> in the ai^scnce of tlrciv God V

ei'der to maintain spiritual comfort^ that thou dost not rely on thy graces and performances, for a title to eternal life. Thou must not presume to rely on them, for even so much as a right to trust in Chiist: thou must not make them, the smallest part of thy warrant, to renew thy exercise of con-^ fidence in him.

• Again: Do believers lose their holy consolation, by living upon their comfort, rather than upon the holy Comforter himself, and by loving the former, fts much as, or more than, the latter ? They may hence perceive that, it is sinful and very displeasing to the Lord, to rely upon the comfort already given them J or lo love consolation in .the streams, more than, or even as much as^ comfort in the fountain. He taketh away sensible comfort from them, because they have loved it inordinatelj', or loved it ' loo much; and because he would teach them ef&c-tually, the necessity of loving the adorable Comforter Himself, more than all the sweet consolation, which they have received from him. .They must not expect, that " the God of all comfort,'* will suffer them to let their love run waste upon their pleasant feelings. He will elevate it all to

' It robs them of their peace. As all true and solid peace is built upon justification bv the blood of Christ, 60 it can only be maintained by the daily exercise of faith, in this comfortable doctrine. ** Being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Chiibt.'^ Horn v. 1. But so far as the legal temper prevails, their peace is set upon another foundation ^ is built upon their enlargements in duty, their frames, and attaiumeDts in xeligion ; and therefore must be un-itablo as water.'

himself. Because he loveth theni) he will 60 cha9* ten them, as to teach them to love himself sap* remely, and to live upon himself, in the absence of B^isible delights. He will teach them to love him^ more for that boundless ocean which is in himself than for the few drops which he had shed upon them ; more for his own infinite benignity, than for the grace or comfort, which he hath commani-cated to them. He will thereby, at the same time, shew them, how weak their love of him is, when they love him chiefly for the comfort which they have received from him; and how weak their fikkh is, when they live upon the streams, rather than upon the overflowing fountain of ccoisolation.

Further: Do believers, by their aggravated offences, provoke the Lord at any time, so to bide his face from them, as to leave them in the darl^ respecting the truth of grace in their hearts ? It follows that, though grace is always in the heart of a holy man, yet he is not always able to disceni it there*. His heart is always the seat of the princi<' pies and habits of grace $ and yet, he doth not coa-tinually enjoy the comfort of perceiving them* The figures of a sun-dial, continue to be plainly marked upon it; ^ and yet we cannot see by it, what hour of the day it is, unless the sun shine upon it. It is only, wlieji gracea/ire in exercise^ and when the glorious Sua.'^f righteousness shineth upon them, that they can be seen. Let not, then, any of the saints conclude, that tliey never hftd, and that they now have not, a well-grounded assurance of their being in a state of grace; because doubts of the truth of grace in them, do sometimes arise in their minds. Their assurance of pefsonal

interest in Christ, is well-grounded and true, though it is far from being perfect. Their graces themselves are imperfect, and therefore that assurance of sense, which arises from the perception of them, must be imperfect likewise. Such believers, as resolve never to rejoice, till they attain perfect annrftnce, must resolve never to rejoice, while they Mxe in this world. They should consider that, there iicf many degrees of real certainty, below a perfect ^kigree ci it; and that, they injure themselves. much, when they call their state of grace into qfwsttoti, as often as they do not perceive clearly. ^Kir habits cfgc^ce.

Once more: Is it only by sinning against the \iigh and holy One, that believeis lose the comfort •of eontmnnion with him ? They may hence discover, what reason they have to abhor^ and with holy. detestation, to turn from all manner of siii. Their iniquity has not only pierced the incarnate Redeemer, and grieved the Holy Spirit; but it pierces themselves through with many sorrows. It is the worst enemy of their souls. It incessantly strives to rob them of then* purest and sweetest joys* Let them therefore without ceasing, strive against the motions, and mortify the members, of the body of sin that dwelleth in them. If they allow, even for a moment, sin to dwell at ease in them; it will

uredly deprive them of dieir holy tranquillity.

CHAPTER IV.

pT THE GMEVOUS GONSKQUESTCES, OP THE CHRIS-TI AS'S HAVING LOST HIS SPIKITUAI. COHSOLATION^

X5t withhcdding spiritual oonsoLrtiaii from tlie souk of any of his people, the Lord, in proportion as he doth it, is represented in the Scriptares, ^as firtaking or deserting them. His forsaking of them, in reqx*ct of comforting infloenoes, dther^m a less or greater degree, is the same as, his widi« d rawing of the sensible influences and tokens of his cpcdal favour from their souls ; or, as it is o{^ ten expressed in the Scripture, his hiding qfhisjaei from thera. When he so forsaketh them, or so hideth the light of his gracious countenance from them, as to suspeqdy in any measure, his influencies of comfort from their souls $ they lose, in the mttie measure, that consoling s^ise of his special iavoor and love to tliem, tvhich hitherto they usually enjoyed. Hie meaning of God's hiding of his face from believers, may, in some degree^ be und€9> stood from the opposite phrases, of his ^* causing his face tq shine upon them," and, bis ^< lifting up the light of his countenance upon them." ITiese phrases appear to carry in them, an allusion to the shining forth of the Shcchinah^ in the ancient Tabernacle and Temple; that is, of the glorious lustre, which dwelt in the clond, as the visible token of Jehovah's favour to the Israelites, and of that graciotts presence with them, which he was pleased, on some solann oc-cssions, peculiarly to manifest. There may also

lie ill lliem, an allusion to tlie pleasant appeannrcc of the countenance of a friend, in a superior station of life, when he converses familiarly with an inferior, whom lie regards with peculiar favour. Ac* cordingly Job, when mentioning the regard shew* €U him by bis attendants says, ** If I laughed on them, or, jested with them, they believed it not, and the ii^bt of my conntenanoe they cast not down * ;" as if he tad said, * They were, on an occasion so agreeable to them, solicitous to do nothing that would so displease me, as to make me firown on them.' And when the Israelitish Church in captivity, prayed to be restored to her former freedom, she said, ** Cause thy face to ^hine, and vre shall be saved ^ ;" that is, ^ Restore us to our former prosperity, and thereby manifest to us thy mercy and thy favour.' On the other hand, God 18 sflod in Scripture, to Inde his face from his children, or, not to cause his countenance to shine tipoB them ; when, as a mark of his paternal dis<-pleosure with their evil condiict, he suspendeth for a season, the wonted influences and tokens of liis ikvour, from their souk. Such forsaking^ there-fore, or suspension of spiritual comfort, though sometimes intended as a fiial of their graces; yet, iS oftener deigned by their heavenly Father, as a grievous chastisement for their sins.

Now, the consequences of their loss of spiritual consolation, are especially the following:

1. Trouble and sorroro of spinlf are consequences of it. " Thou didst hide thy face," saith David, •* and i was trouWed *." And when be was driven

The sensible de» part 11 re of a good and gracious God, from the holy soul, is, like the departure of the ^oul f^om the

the darkness of night, fire is more easily seen at a' distance, than in the light of day. When a holy inan has lost the light of comfort, and is walking in darkness, he has usually a more clear and disquieting sight of his great transgressions, than ivhen he is walking in the light of consolation. The sin of his nature, and the transgressions of hi« life, are, in their deep malignity, and dreadful demerit, thpn set in order before his eyes. The painful recollection of them, with their manifold aggravations, is revived in his mind ; and they appear more horrible in his view, than ever they did before. They are brought afresh to his painful remembrance, as if they had been committed but yesterday. Being set in array before him, each of them gives to his disconsolate spirit, a new, and a deep wound ; which increavSes the smart of his former wounds, and makes them bleed afresh. They present themselves to his troubled mind, with all their aorgravations; as having been committed a-gainst God and Christ, against redeeming love and grace, against the law and the gospel, against mercies and judgments, against the warnings of conscience and the motions of the Holy Spirit, and a-gainst the patience and forbearance of that gracious God, who hath so loved him, as to give his only begotten Son to die for him. Holy Job, when in such a condition, said, " Thou writest bitter things against me, and jmakest me to possess the iniquities of my youth «/* And X)avid, " My sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight \*^ ^* Mine iniqui-

ties have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up: they are more than the hairs of mine bead; therefore my heart faileth me'." ITius the backsliding believer, is sent back again to mount Sinai, where he finds the devouring flames of the fiery law, flashing in his face. His convictions now are deeper, and his seorchtngs hotter, than perhaps they ever were before. The Lord permitteth the tremendous curse of the violated law, to re-enter his conscience; and thereby . He shews him, the awful demerit of his innumera-* ble ofiences K Perceiving that, he hath sinned ift the midst of evangelical light, of frequent checks of conscience, of manifold mercies, enjoyments, enlargements', andf experiences j he begins, it may be, to dread, that he may have committed even the unpardonable sin. A sense of thehorrible malignity, and dreadful demerit of his transgressions, strikes ft deep impression on his soul, and makes his heart to tremble. His conscience upbraids him with his criminal foUy, and his base ingratitude, in sinning against his gracious God and Saviour. Hence, cutting reflections, self-condemning and galling thoughts, often disquiet his mind *. He can now think almost of nothing, but the awful majesty, sovereignty, holiness, justice, and vengeance of the Lord. " He remembers God and is troubled "*.'' His spirit is troubled, yea, overwhelmed, when he rrfects that he hath provoked the just, the omnipotent, the great and terrible God, to appear as an enemy against him. Or, if he think at all of

» Ps. xl. 12. ^ Rom. v. 20. * Ps.lxxiii. 21, 22. ** Ps. Ixxvjj. 3,

ibe mercy of God, be will be disposed to argut thus: < Surely, if my transgressions had not been peculiarly heinous, or, if I had so much as a single spark of grace in me; an infinitely merciful God would not have thus forsaken me.^ Ah ! sin, cofii-loitted against the high arid holy Majesty of hea«» ven, is a strange, a horrible diing! If the Lor4 should, at once, discover fully to the exerdaed Christian, all the hideousness of this infernal mon* ster, the discovery would be utterly intolerable to him*

3. A distressing apprehension^ that some overwhelm^ ing judgment will suddenly be inflicted upon them» because of their great o£Pences, is dften a consequence of their loss of holy comfort. Heman i^ prdiended that such judgments were to come upoQ him, as would cut him off"^ The diseonsojat* Christian, under a deep sense of accumulated guil^ is frequ^itly strudc with fear, that an ofiended God Kill inflict upon him, %omQ sudden and terrildt ]puwluneDt. A filial and holy fear of Divine ygtAgi mentfi, arising from the consideration of the great evil of sin, and of Jehovah's infinite right^oufiness^ 4U(id abhorrence of iniquity, as well as c^histre* mendous wrath revealed against it; is, indeed^ lawful, and should at all times be exercised by th# saints. " O Lord, I have heard thy cpeech," says Habakkuk, ^^ and was afraid ^." And David^ *'Thou puttest away all the wicked of the eard^ like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies. My flesh trembleth for fear of thee i and I am afraid of thy judgments P." But, when a holy man has

" Ps. Ixxxvliu 5. ® Hab, ilL 2. ^ Ys^ cxviu 119, iW-

LOST HXS SPIRITUAL CONSOLATION. 127"

deprived bimselfof comfort, he commonly yields to a slavish and excessive^ dread of the judgments of God. When he hears, tliat a thousand have £dlen at his right hand, and ten thousand at his left, he trembles like a leaf of the forest. In such a condition, be is disposed to indulge a disquieting, di&> tracting, and tormenting fear; a fear, which unset* ties his mind, suspends his exerci^ of faith, disturbs bis peace, destroys liis hope, and instigates faim to impatience, and to the use of unlawful means, in order to escape the danger that threatens him. A fear of tliis kind is very sinful, as well as unbecoming, in a true Chrit>tain: it alienates his heart from the Lord, and dUquaiifies him for the spiritual performance of his duty. Since he is wallEtBg in darkness, a thousand imaginary fears^ 4uqsiiet and perplex hi^ souL lie Js now reudiec than formerly, to be imposed upon by imaginary ' dangers, and to be *^ in great ti^ar, where no fear is#/' Although the Lord bath promised to him^ ihat ^* no r^eal evil shall t)efal biin ^ ;" that no a&Iic^ tioift shall ever come upon him^.but what will it^ue from the greatest love, and terminate in thc<.;roi:t* est good, to him; yet he can almost think oi nothing, but of immineut danger on every side: and his groundless and gloomy fears of it, render him inexpressibly uneasy. Such fears, are so many gall-* iog tetters to his imprisoned soul; and when he ' woukl at any time, try to shake them off, his quick sense of total inability, discourages hiin. From this, ^ they take occasion to become still more oppressive 1^ him. Hence is tliat mournful expression of

« Ps. Jiii. 5. ' Vs. xci, V«^.«-

F.4 :•

128 CONSEqUENCES OF A BELIEVER-S HAVING

Job; ** If I say, I will forget my complaint, I wift leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself j I aiA afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent *."

4^ Great uncertainty of mind, about their present^ and their future state, is usually a consequence of the suspension of spiritual consolation from their souls. Now that the Christiaa is walking in darkness, lie cannot as formerly, see, either his warrant to tru«t as a siimer, in Christ, for sahration to himself in paiticular; or, any good evidence of his having ever yet trusted in him^ Having lost the light of God's gracious countenance^ and of holy comfort, he has consequently, and in the same proportion^ lost sight of his vital union with the Saviour, and of his personal interest in His righteousness and salvation. Hence great and sad doubts^ what will become of him for the future, frequently disquiet his mind. '^ He who walketh in. this* darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth ^" Uiw belief prevaileth. so much against him, that he oftea questions, whether «Iesus Christ can, or will, save such a great sinner as he is, and whether God will have mercy upon him, or not. He is in perplex*-ing. and painful uncertainty, what the great and terrible God may be about to do with him, when he is to depart hence; and he often suspects the worst: yea, his doubts may be suffered to prevail so much, as to make him conclude that, the Lord \yill be favourable to him no more. Thus Asaph,, in a siniilar case, expresseth himself; '^ Will the Lord cast off for ever ? and will he be favourable

* J.oh» ix. 27, 28, ^ J<Aa xiL 35*.

nor more? is his mercy clean gone forever? dotb his promise fail for evermore ? hath God forgottei> to be gracious ? hath he in anger shut up his- tender mercies " ?" And the Israelitish Church, in hev captivity, saith, ** My strength and my hope are perished from the Lord ^.'* When the holy soul is in darkness, it will often argue thus: * The Lord hath departed from me, and, it may be, he will never return to me. Oh! what will become of me^ if I am never to enjoy communion with Him any more! What if I shall have my portion, through all eternity, with hypocrites and unbelie-ters, in the place of torment! I have now, no cheering Kght, no enlivening hope, and, perhaps, I aitt soon* to be cast into* outer darkness.' The Clmstianp, in this perplexing condition, hath, indeed, some lucid intervals, now and then; but, as one expresses it. They are like the small breathings, and refreshments, of a person who is newly taken off the Rack, and is about to be carried to the Rack agaim If it is accounted a bitter ingredient in the cup of outward affliction, to be kept in suspense concerning any object, which is deemed necessary and important to our temporal welfare ; how distressing must it be to the spirit of a fioly man, to be held in suspense between hope and fear, respecting objects, which are absolutely requisite, and infinitely important, to his eternal felicity ! As a natural man cannot be at ease, without natural'accommodations, or the possession o£ Mich things, as are adapted to the comfort of natural life $ 80> a spiritual man cannot be quiete^

5^ Another consequence of their having provoked their heavenfy Father, to withhold comfort from them, is, their uttering of heartless and useles$ complaints. ** Even to-day,'* saith Job, ** is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than jny groaning *." And Asaph, " I complained, and my ipirit w^ overwhelmed ^,*' Some believers, after iheyhave lost their wonted consolation, are not Et first, deeply sensible of the greatness of their loss $ and therefoi^e^ though they mention witli soi^ TOW their waot of former comfort, yet their mr^ som is &r from being very deep.

tedy when he can allow hiimelf, to utter scrdi clam^ ours. He undoubtedly, at that time, forgets the infinite freenes% suitableness, fulness^ and sufficien-eyy of the grace which is in Christ Jesus* Besides^ he thereby shews plainly, that his grief and fear are, after all, far from being great. When sorrow and fear are shallow or superficial, they are usual* ly clamorous; but when they are great and deep, they are commonly silent: they are so great, that they cannot be expressed ^; and, therefore, like the waters of a large and deep river, they move silent-Ifif So long as the dejected Christian is able to complain, methinks, instead of complaining to others around him, only of an absent God and Saviour^; he should complain of himself rather, and fthould complain of himself cliiefiy to the Lord^ wlio only can relieve him.

6. A deep and painful sense of.GoiTs pcttermd

angerf is also a consequence, and a concomitant

-thereof. Though believers are, in their justiSca^

tion, so entirely delivered from condemnation to

vindictive and eternal wrath, as to be no longer

exposed to wrath of thai kind ^; yet, by sinning

(which after their justification they do) against the

Lord, not as their avenging Judge, but as their

gracimis God and Fathe7\ they incur the guilt ef

^fatherly anger. By the fatherly anger of God, i»

. meant, his holy and righteous displeasure with hia

disobedient children, which is manifested by his

infliction of chastisement i^on them. In this man»

ner, tlie Lord .was angry with Moses % and wi&

his ancient Church, the members of which, e5cpos« tulate with him thus: <^ O God| why hast thou cast us off for ever ? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture ^ ?'' When tlie Lord is so displeased with any of his children, as to withdraw from them, the sense of his special fiivour, he commonly, at the same time, imprcsseth on their souls in place of it, a sense of his paternal anger. Instead of cheering them, with that de-lightfiil sense of his redeeming love to them, which they formerly enjoyed ^ he fixeth deep in their flonls, a painful feeling of his being angry with them. ** For the iniquity of his covetousness,'^ siuth Jehovah, ** was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth ^J* When the Lord is wroth with any of his people for their iniquities, he will not only hide his face from them, or deprive them of the cheering sense of his favour; but he will smite them likewise: and this he will dc^ not only by some external stroke of his rod, on their bodies or estates; but, sometimes, by an ii»-temal and deep impression of his anger, on their souls. And, if depriving them of the cheering sense of Grod's favour, is connected with the feeling of his hot di^leasure, an inexpressibly bitter and grievous conflict in their souls^ must ensue. Therefore hath the Lord said, ** I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spi-. rit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made ^/' When God is wroth with his child-ren, he makes iheaxfeel his displeasure $ either, by frowning so upon them, that they shall for a sea-

Ijd* deed, ;Krhen the Lord impreseetli on their spirits, a < deep and fixed sense of his anger, no creatiu'e can afford to them the smallest consolation. - In wm, will they seek for ease to their oppressed souls, in business^ or nmusements, or^ay company. FrieaiU may, indeed, mouim wtthtb^m.; but, as one expresses it, * they cannot wipe away their teaJE«.*<*->-2Jorjcan.they, then, find relief, even^in tbecotii'* luinoes of God. Every threatening o£ hi»holy law, > appears as an arrow aimed at their heart* Eveiy : promsae of his blessed go^l, however fidl of coo-:fiolation to othero, seems empty to them. £veiy • oSsr of a JSavioiur, and of his great aalvatien, how-•6ver unlimited, appears to be directed to other sin-new, and not to them. The. Lord himself js«em-«tii to them, as Hhe were taking no notice of their distress, yea, as if he were an enemy to their souis. We are not to wonder then, if, in such A'Case^ they ifeej ^NrcrwbelmJoig trouble and anguish of-spirit^*

Indeed, it k because the Lord etill laveth them, and sesolveth to save them $ that, i^hen he sees

■

them running on to sin and misery, his paternal anger thus overtakes them, in order to stop, and bring them back again, to the comfort of holy con-finrmity to the image of his Son Jesus Christ.

7. A most dfstressing serise even of the vindictive wrath ofGod^ is, sometimes, a consequence of their k>8fi of comfort. True believers indeed, can never be cast into hell; but the Lord may,^ as it were, cast hell into them. Some of them, accordingly, "when Crod hath hid his face from tliem, have been permitted, rashly and falsely to conclude that, because they cannot see him now, they never saw ]]im ; that, because tbey cannot perceive their evi«-Jences of grace now, they never bad true grace ^ that, as they never had true grace formerly, they liave no saving grace now; and that| the anger of God whidi they now feel, is not his &therJy displeasure, but his vindiUive wrath ^. Thus they unjustly, as wdi as rtushly, conclude that what tbejr -now fi^I, is an impression of revenging wrath. It is of this wrath, that Heman seems to complaiA, when be saids, '^ Thy wrath lielh hard upoya me: Thy fierce wrath goedi over me *'•" In like mannerj one of the prophets saitb, ^^ I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my diink with wee^m^i because of tblne indignaticm, and thy wradi^^ The sense of vindictive wrath, is much more dole-fid, and intolerable, than even thai; of paternal anger: and therefore the Psalmist prays that,, jf be

o Ps. Ixxxviii. 14. » Ps. Ixxxviii. 7, 16.

^ JPs» i>iL 9, 10.

136 CONSEftUEKCES OF A BELIEVER's HAVING

mtist be chastened, that greatest of alV chastise-^ nients, may not be inflicted upon him : ** O Lord, -rebuke me not in thy wrath; neither chasten Hie in thy hot displeasure *".** He^prayeth not merely, that the Lord may not punish him in vindictive ivrath; but, that he may not so chasten him, as to lay him under an overwhelming impression of that intolerable wrath.

When the soul- of a holy mam is, for a sensoir, under that direful impression, he can see nothing*, feel nothing, but consuming wrath. Conscious as he is, tlmt he deserveth the fierceness of eternal wrath, he is filled with dreadful apprehensions, that the hand which presseth him sore, is the hand, not of a mercifttl Father, but of an avenging Judge; casting him down, as a condemned criminal,^ int^ a deep and horrible dungeon. Ileman, under a. sense of that wrath, complains to the Lord thus^ ^* 1 hou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness,, in the deeps *." When a saint is under terrible impressions of Jehovah's infinite wrath, he cannot but be under great horror of conscience, and in^ 'perplexing depths of mental trouble. The sense' which he hath of avenging wrath, occasions a cat^ Aid in his spirit, inexpressibty agonizing and terrible. When hia troubled conscience is inflamed, by a sense of tl>e fiery indignation of God almighty, the more he thinks of Him as his infinite eno-*myj the more he is dismayed ^: every thought of iim^ brings dolefiil tidings, and pours oil upon tbe raging flame. Trouble of conscience for sin, is indeed very disquieting; but, a sense ofthe vi]>

'^Ps, xxxviii, !• « Ps. lsxx\u\, 6* * Pe* !xxvii..3*

LOST HIS SPIRITUAL CONSOLATION. 137

dieiive wrath of God, kindled in the conscience, is still more dreadful. No words can express the direful anguish, which the diseonsolate soul then feels ^, The Christian cannot at that time, think so much as one quieting, one cheering thought* What he first thinks of, is tormenting to his wounded spirit: he changes that thought for an*-other, and that is still more tormenting. He finds himself entangled, as in the midst of a thicket of thorns i so that, which way soever he turns him« self^ he is pierced and grieved afresh. This dismal thought often arises in his troubled mind; That if death were, in his present condition, to surprise and cut him ofiP, he should sink for ever and ever, under the intolerable wrath of the infinite Jehovah. The mo8t exquisite torment of body is almost nothing, in comparison of the anguish of his spirit, at such times ^. Oh ! how inconceivable is the anguish, the agony, especially of a holy soul, when it is conflicting with the tremendueus wrath of the eternal God ! The bodily torture even of crucifixion, could not extort from the holy Jesus, the smallest sigh or complaint ; but the sense of his Father's wrath in his soul, wrung from him that doleful outcry, *• My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me ' ?"

8. Another consequence of their having deprived themselves of spiritual comfort, h ^veiwhefming ier^ rar. Terror is an excessive fear and trembling of heart ^. The troubled soul begins to dread, that its present feeUng of vindictive wrath, is but the

»^ Vs. cxvi. 3. ^ Prov. xviii. 14. * Mat. xxvii, 46. I Gei]^ XV. 12. Acts Lx. G.

beginning of what it shall have to fee), through an endless eternity. *' The terrcxrs of God," saith Job» ** do set themselves in array against me ' :*^ ** Destruction from God was a terror to me *•** And Heman, ** While I suffer thy terrors, I am distracted. Thy fierce wrath goeth over me, thy terrors have cut me off**." The Lord {)ennitteth lome of his children, when tliey are under the hid^* ings of his face, not only, to draw from that awful dispensation, false conclusions, with r^ard to their past and present state; but, to form rash and dei* pondent conclusions, concerning their future con<» dition. They then conclude that, it will never be better with them, as to their outward afflictions* Hezekiah, in a similar case, said, *^ I shall uot see the Lord, even the Lord in the land of tiie living: I shall beliold man no more with the inhabitajUs dF the world ^" They likewise conclude that, it wiU never be better with tliem in this world, with respect to their inward troubles. '< I.shall go so^ aU xny years," said Hezekiali, ^' in the bitter* ness of my sonl*^." Nay, under tlie prevaienoa of unbelief, ajid of despondency, tliey perempto* rily conclude tliat, the Lord whom they have greats ]y displeased, will cast them off, and^punish them with everlasting destruction in the world to come. They do not merely question, as Asaph did, if the Lord vnll be favourable to them any more; but they rashly and positively conclude, that he never inll. They say, as the house of Israel did, ^' Out bones are dried, and our hope is lost; we are cut

* Job VI. 4. • Job xxxi 23. ^ Vs. Ixxxviii. 15, 141. ^ IsH. jcxxviii, II, ^ isa. x%x^liL 15,.

off for our parts ^ :^ and as the Israelitish Church did, ** Mj strength and my hope are perished £1*001 the Lord ^" Tbk they do, not during a short fic of despondency, or in their haste, as David; but, for a long time. ^^ When neither sun nor stars" of consolation, ** in many days, appear, all hope that they shall be saved, seemeth to be taken a« way.*' Those awful passages of Scripture, in which *^ the wrath of God is revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and unrigfateouuiess of men, who iu>ld the truth in unrighteousness,'' do continually present themselves to their view: and by a strange kind of belief, they ^prehend that even every part of the word, as well as every dispensation of the {UDOvidence, of God, is the sword of an enemy ^ that promises, as well as threatenings; that mer-cieSy 88 well as judgments, are against them ; and tliat by all, the Lord, as with a flaming sword tamipg «very way, doth hinder their access to the tvee of life. Terrors, like fire, ashiniilate every fthisg ta their own nature; and so they render de« jected souls unable, to put a just, or a favourable odns'truction, upon any of the words, or dispensa^ tions of the Lord.

The terrors of God may indeed be felt, but they cannot be expressed. They are inconceivably dreadful and overwhelming. They are " the arrows of the Almighty, within a man, the poison whereof, drinketh up his spirit ^ •/' wounding him in the most vital and tender part, they cause his spirit within him to pine away, and almost to die. < I shall doubtless perish/ saith the aSrighted soul.

140 CONSEQUENCES OF A BEUEVER's HAVING

^ I am undone, for ever undone; I am already, nn it were, in the place of torment, under inexpressible anguish, insupportable terror. The great and terrible God hath cast me off; and I see nothing before me, but horrible darkness, blackness of darkness for ever. The shadows of the evening, are stretched out over me; and what will beccHne of me, if it shall prove an endless nigirt! Qh I what will my eternal state be, should death surprise me m my present condition ! If I cannot now bettr even a slight impression of the anger of God; ho«r shall I be able to endure the full weight, the eternal fierceness, of his avenging wrath I If I. am so troubled, so terrified^ so* amazed, now; what shifi I do, when my tremendous doom shall be pronoum:^ ed, and the endless execution of-it begun !^ Oh! what overwhelmmg horror, what direful agony, must an awakened and disconsolate soul feel, in.the awful prospect of suflferir^ the vengeance of eternal fire ! Oh ! eternity, eternity, how, in the night of terror, doth the prospect of eternity, amaze and even absorb the spirit!

9. Satan's being permitted to add to the trouble and terror of believers, is usually a consequence of their having forfeited their spiritual comfort. In tliat condition, they are commonly ^^in heaviness througli manifold temptations **." When the Lord is chastening any of his chiklren, for being more ready to believe the lies of 3atan, than the truths of His holy word; he often permitteth that crafiy ^d cruel enemy, to hold them down, and to terrify' them. And so far as he is permitted, his constant

LOST HIS SPIRITUAL CONSOLATION. 141

work is, to render them as uncomfortable in their way to heaven, as possible. Thus he treated Job. llie spiritual trouble, and the dismal terror of that holy man, were, for the 'most part, from the immediate hand of Satan. When this enemy of souls perceives, that believers constantly resist his temptations to presumption, he assaults them with furious, and horrible temptations to despair. And when he observes any of them under a sense of Divine anger, and a dread of eternal wrath, he oonunonly selects this as the fittest opportunity, to enforce those temptations. He then, especially, labours to persuade them that, when God is afflicting them with such great severity, it is a sure evidence that, he is not their God, but their adversary, and that, they are not his people, but his enemies. He misrepresents both God and themselves to them, and so insults them in their misery. When that cowardly enemy perceives, that their spirit is already broken down, he makes his most furious assaults on tliem ; for he knows that when they are once cast down, he can the more easily trample on, and afflict them. No sooner doth the Lord depart, than Satan comes: becomes to triumph over their anguish, and to say, • Where now is your God ? Remember that, your iniquities have been peculiarly great and aggravated, and that, ye have thereby provoked the Lord finally to abandon you: ye do ali*eady feel his fiery indignation, and you have reason, good reason, to dread that you shall'endure it for ever.' He takes occasion from their anguish of spirit, to represent the Lord to them, as a cruel tyrant, as one who hath resolved to destroy them. And when they aleady fear, and even feel^ that God hath

dq>arted from them, what can thejr say in answer to him? Perceiving their distressi and knowing their weakness, he, with amazing dexterity, and unwearied importunity, urges against them, eveft: passages of Scripture, and dispensations of provid*« ence, in order to enforce his infernal suggestioM* When he sees that their faith is very w^ik, and that their sense of Divine displeasure is very deep; he then shoots his fiery darts, which penetrate and inflame their souk, with additional angoish and horror K It is a pleasant sight to that wicked one^ to behold God afflicting his children; and to see, were it but one of them, wounded with grieb, broken with terrors, made, " a brother to dragons,-and a companion to owls '^." . He, therefore, afte» they have been long disquieted, and enfeebled by desponding fears, assaults them furiously; • in ordev that, when they are already pressed down, he may throw upon them additional weight.

It is his usual method, so to impress terror on their minds, that it frequently comes upon them' by sudden fits. These fits or paroxysms commonly return, whenever the troubled soul would pro-' mise itself some degree of ease. Accordingly, the usual time of refreshing the body with food and sleep, are for ordinary, the seasons which Satan watches, for his renewed assaults '. He commonly injects, at such times, blasphemous and atheistical thoughts, which fill them with horror j and when he has thereby prepared their hearts, he seizes the opportunity to persuade them, that such a

heart, must be whc^ destitote of T^geherhting grace. And when he perceives, that any of them •re afflicted with mehmcholy^ he considers that^ M a distemper which affords him advantages, peculiarly suited to his design: the imaginati<m is then disordered, and so is fitter than at any other time, to receive impressions from him. It also a& fiirds him much advantage, if they have lately £iU* en into some great and grievous sins; especially, ■s one observes "*, into sins against the third, or sixth, or sevairth commandment Arguing from sacli crimeSy he labours to persuade them, that they are reprobated, and doomed to eternal destruction. When he perceives, that they have been guilty of some atrocious iniquity, he will suggest, that It is even the unpardonable sin. He argues likewise £rom their perturbation of spirit, that tlieir heart is so hardened by the.deceitfulness of sin, as to be utterly incapable of exercising repentance unto life« The more he distracts and amazes their minds with terrors, the more unable they are, to detect the fiillacy of his arguments, and the more dispos* ed tliey are, to admit the force of thorn. Excessive fear, removes their souls to such a distance from true comfort, that they will not be persuaded to trust in the Lor4 Jesus, either for his salvation^ or for the joy of that salvation. Under such perplexing fears, they seem disposed so far to take part with Satan, as, with much eageimess, and won* derful subtilty, to plead against themselves. Believer, when thy transgressions are, at any time, so exceedingly aggravated in thy view, as to ex*-

Oh ! be henceforth so wise for thyself, as no longer to expect truth from a liarj or sound argument from a deceiver, or true comfort from an enemy.

10. To be discountenanced or cddiy treated bg ChristianJrtendsi is often a consequence of a belie* ver's having forfeited his spiritual comfort. When the LfOrd is angry with his rebellious child, and is chastening him; he not only giveth Satan leave to trouble him, but permittcth some of the saints who are acquainted with him, to discountenance fainii and by their coM treatment of him, to add to his grief. When the Father of a family resolves, the more effectually, to correct his obstinate child^ he will say to the rest of his household, ^ Do not* be familiar with him ; shew himjiocountenance; put him to shame.' In like manner, when the Lord is smiting, especially with spiritual trouble, liis disobedient child, he, as it were, saith to others of his children, • Have for a season no familiarity with him: treat him with coldness and neglect; in order that he may be asliamed, and humbled for his iniquity/ Job, under his grievous affliction, complained thus, •* He hath put my brethren far from me, and mipe acquaintance are utterly estranged from me, &c "." And likewise Heman, •* Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them. Lover and friend, hast thou put far from me, and

mine acquaintimce iftto darkness °." When the &YOur of God to the soul is clouded, the comfort of Christian society 4s also obscured. When He irowDs on one, his children commonly appear to irownBkewise; and when he makes hhnseU^strange to'one, «o for tlie most part do they. If a h(Jy man, then, under trouble of spirit, begins to be treated with idisregard, and even with contempt, by some of liis Christian brethren, he ought not to he snrprised; iieither-should he-take occasion to be angry, or to quarrel with them ; but he should look ab^W^fiiem, and talcc thcaiHictive dispensation, OTjif rat of the hand of the Lord, as a necessary part of the chastisement intended for him. He ought to say with respect to them, as David said concerning Shimei, " ^fhe Lord hath bidden /them;" or, as Hemandid, " Thou hast put away 'ibine acquaintance far from me.*^

11. Hard thoughts of God, nndjealoiis thoughts ■of Christ, do often take occasion to arise from the 'vrant Of comfort, cspecidly, if believers have remained long in that condition.

is dean gone for ever, and such like. When dejection and terror continue long, they obscure the mind, and cause it to form and entertain gloonay, yea, monstrous apprehensions. Hence are, these words of Job; *^ He performeth t^e thing th^tt is, appointed for me; and many such things.a^e with him. Therefore son I trouble^ bX his presence t when I consider, I am afraid of him.. For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me; because I was not cut off before the dark-ness P."

Jealcms t/ioug/its of Christy the glorious.h^ad and husband of believing souls, do likewise arise from, the disconsolate heart. If souls have hard thoaghts of God, they will quickly entertain jealous thoughts of Christ Jesus. And if they but begin to suspect, that Christ doth not love them, or that he is not. faithful in peribrming his promises to them ^ they will be afraid to take his word, and afraid to trust him, or to commit themselves and their salvation to him. Christian, be continually on thy guard, against unbelieving and suspicious thoughts of the love of Christ, to thy soul. Trust firmly that he loveth thee, and careth for thee, and ^that he will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. Thy sensible comfort may leave theej but thy faithful Re-ileemer, the husband of thy soul, will never totally or finally forsake thee. He may indeed for a season, '^ cause grief; but he will have compassion, according to the inultitude of his mercies *>." Say not then, when he hideth his face from thee, ^ He hath utterly forsaken me ;* but rather, in the

exercise of unsnspecting confidence in him and in iris love to thee^ say, « He will turn again, he will have compassion upon me; he will subdue my ini^* quities, and will cast all my sins, into the depths of the sea '•" O guard against jealous thoughts of thy infinitely faithful Redeemer. Do not suspect hint without ground. The moment, thou art jealous of his love to thee, thou sinnest against him with-* out & cause. The Lord Jesus at no time, so conducts himself, in his ways of grace and providence toward thee, as to give thee the smallest cause to suspect his faithfulness'. And if thou wouldst never suspect his kindness and faithfulness to thy soul, till thou had a cause, it is all that he would desire, llemember that, to be jealous of the holy Jesus, is to sin, not only against Him, but agamst thyself. ** Jealousy is the rage of a mm\ ' ;*' -and ** it is crudi, or, hard as the grave "." It will disquiet and torture thy soul; it will waste thy spirits, and prey upon thee, like the grave. Thou, indeed, hast been unfaithful, very unfaithful to the Lord Jesus; but this, though a ground of deep humilia* lion, yetis no ground at all, for suspecting his faith^ fulness to his own promise, upon which he hath caused thee to hope ^.

12. Another consequence of their loss of spiritual consolation, is, their being usually so discomposed and ^dispirited thereby, as to become at the tinie,.f*i2^^r the spiiitiial pctfoimance qftlieir duty. This will more especially be the case with tliem, if, as is too common, they, in their disconsolate con-

dition, forbear to tnnst in the Saviour for present and eternal salvation. Though their obedience is not accepted, on account of dieir faith; yet, it is spiritually good and acceptable, in proportion to the strength, and the frequency, of their actings of &ith. If then, they cease for a season, to act faith, they, in the same proportion, cease for that time, to perform spiritual and acceptable obedience to the Lord I for *^ without faith, it is impossible to please him *." It is not sufficient, in order to acceptable obedience, that Christians have faith in principle, and even in habit: they must likewise have it in exercise; and that, even when they walk in darkness, and have no light of sensible comfort ^, But if, in the darkness of spiritual trouble, they forbear for a season, to trust in the Lord Jesus, for complete salvation to themselves in particular; that trouble will so disquiet and dispirit them, as to disqualify them, either for doing or for sufferings according to the will of God. " I am," saith He-m^n, ** as a man that hath no strength *." Nay, it hath made some of them even think that, it is to no purpose for them^ to endeavour spiritually to perform any duty.. Indeed their souls, when in tliat doleful condition, are commonly so much occupied with the fear of eternal wrath, that sin as sin, and duty as duty, are but little considered by them. Moreover, that conscience by which, they judge themselves to be still under the guilt of all their sins, is in the Scripture called " an evil can" science * j" a conscience which, the blood of Christ

* H«^b. xl. 6. y Is?* 1.10. * Ps. Ixxxvlii, 4.

tOSTHlS SPIRITUAL CONSOLATION. 149^

ihust*purge from dead works, in order to their be* ing capacitated to serve the living God**. Love^ which is the fulfilling of the law, and the end of the commandment, must arise out of a ^ooc? conscience, as well as out of a pure heart *. That evil or guilty conscience, by which disquieted Christians judge that the .Lord is still their enemy, because of their sins; doth greatly strengthen the remaining enmity of their hearts, against Him; and so it indisposes them, for affectionate and filial obedience to him. For, in proportion as they decline in their love to him, they are hardly drawn to him in any spiritual service, and easily drawn from him : they come slowly, and depart readily % thcj approach with reluctance; and while they stand before him, it is with hesitation and dislike.

Besides, as spiritual joy raises and invigorates the spirit; so carnal and legal sorrow depress^ and enfeebles it. All sorrow, except godly sorrow, lies like lead on the heart, cold and heavy, and presses it still downward. It likewise makes the soul contract itself, or shrink from that spiritual intercourse with God in Christ, which it ought, eagerly and incessantly to pursue. Under the pressure of sadness, especially when it is accompanied with terror, believers themselves find no heart to pray, and no life in praying. They bow their knees; they sigh and cry; but the Lord secmeth not to regard them, nor to return answers of peace to their prayers. Their thoughts are, for the most part, in a continual tumult; and so, iq all their efforts to pray, wandering and perplex*

ing thoc^htsr do sadly preTail against tbem. Their sadness greatly abates their vigour of spirit, and destroys their freedom of speech: It dampeth also their faith, and hope, and love; and so, it mars their prayers, as well as all their other spiritual jexercises. Plnding that, they are still as perplexed, and as disconsolate, after prayer, as before it, and fearing that, their prayer is an abomination to the Lord; they are almost at the point of giving it over. They are troubled, isrhen they do not pray j and when they -would pray, they find that they cannot. Sometimes, when the trouble of their mind, becomes ^eat and violent, it suppres* fies their words, andean itself find no vent. **! am so troubled," says Asaph, *^ that I canaot speak '^." The waters of thehr trouble and anguish, do so drown their cries, that they either cannot pray at all, or can find no liberty, no plefw* sure, no relief, in their prayers.

13. ;Lastly, The joint effect of those consequences above mentioned, frequently is, that the natu^ ral spirits begin to be disordered and dejected. Trouble of mind, especially when it is great, or of long continuance, commonly produces this dSect Such is the nature of the union, between the soul and the body, that there is almost never, any vigorous exercise of any of the affections or passions of the soul, without some corresponding effect thereby produced on the motion of the fluids, and especial* ly, of the natural spirits, of the body. The motion pf the animal spirits, is thereby altered; whence often arises some bodily sensation, especia% aboal

the hearty and other parts essential to life, which are the fountains of those fluids. So much, is the body subjected to the soul, and so much, do the spirits of ihe body, depend on the affections of the soul; that the exercise of any one of the affections, has a direct tendency to produce some sensible efiect on the body : and if the exercise of any one of them, be great or violent, it will produce an effect, proportionably great and violent. Accordingly, the holy Psalmist, expressing his vehement desire of communion with God in public ordinances, says, ^* My soul thirsteth for thee, my JlcsA longeth for thee */' And again^ •* My heart and my Jlesh cry out for the living God^" Now, the affections of grief and fear do, -in proportion to the degree of their exercise, contract the natural lipirits, and render their motions feeble and slow. The consequence is, that the vi-.gour of the body commonly declines: its motions become sluggisli. The lamp of life burns dimly* The countenance grows dejected; the complexion waxes pale; and no liveliness, nor activity, seems ^ remain. Hence arc these complaints in Scrip-•ture i " On my eye-lids is the shadow of death ^.'^ ** I am become like dust and ashes ^." " My moisture is turned into the drought of summer K" ^* There is no soundness in my flesh, because of thine anger'^.*' " I am become like a bottle in the smoke *." ** My soul is full of troubles, and my life draweth nigh unto the grave ^."

the motion of the spirits of the body, is retarded and altered, by the influence of the grief and fear of the soul; so this alteration, ei^cially if it coi>-tiuue for a considerable time, will at length, pro-^ ilucc that disorder which is called melancholy. Though melancholy, which is indeed & distemper of the body, is totally distinct from trouble of mind, strictly so called; yet the former often proceeds from, mid is increased by .the latter; and the latter again, is reciproeally augmented, and often prolonged by the former. For,, as the soul-cannot but feel with the body, in its pain; so the body cannot be exempted from sharing with thr Houly in its trouble.

Having now considered the leading consequences of the loss of spiritual comfort, it will be proper to observe, in order to prevent mistakes, that, in the case of some disconsolate Christians, all these cense sequences concur j but, in that of others, only som^ of them take place. It is seldom, except whea spiritual distress becomes very deep, and continues long, that* they are all felt by one and the same b&-liever« Spiritual trouble usually consists either, in the loss of corafbrt> together with all those consequences of it; or, in the want of comfort, with some of them only, and tliat ia a greater or less degree. Accordingly it^ is> either total or partiaL Some believers have been afflicted with total difr^ tr£ss of soul, so that they have, in a certain d^^reei, even despaired, of mercy.

that any of the saiiits, ever fall into a degree of despair ; it will, surely, be more harsh and uncharitable to affirm, that none who ever do fall into despair, are saints. Indeed it cannot be deni-eti, that some of the saints, under the deepest anguish cf spirit, have for a time so despaired, as to have been overwhelmed with terror, in the dreadful prospect of eternal wrath. Other believers again, upon their loss of comfort, arc afflicted only with partial trouble of mind, and are soon delivered from it. They have, indeed, painful experience of some, or even of the most of those consequences above mentioned, but not of all. They have, it may be, a painful sense of paternal anger ; but, being enabled still to trust, that the hand which afflictcth their souls, is the hand of a Father, and not of an enemy, they are exempted from an overwhelming sense of avenging wrath: or tliey may, perhaps, have some feeling even of vindictive wrath j and yet, be under but a very small degree of despondency". Those of the saints, who have even all those doleful consequences, of their having forfeit* ed their holy consolation, may have them in a greater or less d^ee; and those who have only some of them, may Ukewise have these in various degrees. Trouble of mind in some believers, is transient and short; in others, is fixed, of long continuance, and sometimes, attended with very alarming symptoms. But still, however short, and however low in degree, it be; the very lowest degree of it, is ■ inconceivably .more intolerable and dreadful) than the highest d^ree of bodily aJB9ictio2t»

^ Pfi. JjExxviii. I, G5

154 CONfEjJUENCES OF A BELIEVER's HAVING

Norr from the foregoing detail, the following remarks are obvious:

First, Trouble of mind, especially when it h excessive, is iwl in iiseif good^ but evil. It is sinful in true Christians, to suffer themselves to be disquieted by, and to languish under, despondent fears, as if they had not a compassionate Saviour^ to trust in. Deep dejection of Spirit, producer miich aversion of heart, from the spiritual performance of every duty. It is contrary to the great duty of believing. Faith is a resting; this trouble is a disquiettnent, of the heart: faith is the eye of the soul; such trouble, is the blrndness and daric-Jiess of the soul: faith giveth glory to God j thi» ^reflects dishonour upon him. It is not only a sin, but a most heinous sin, to yield so to dejection of .spirit, as to refuse to be comforted. The troubled ttpirit of the Christian, actually rises against re-«leeniing grace. It is well for him in such a case, that the covenant of grace, in which he is still instated, is well ''ordered in all things;" that it stands, like a well-marshalled army on the fieW, ready to resist liis attacks, upon whatever part 6f it, he may choose to fall. Be deeply conviritced, 0 disquieted believer, that thy refusing to trust in the Saviour aiid to be comforted, is thy aggravated sin; and that it is inexpressibly dangerous, as well as sinful, to allow despondenty and trouble to grow upon thy spirit.

Next, The most tender compassion from all, and

Especially from fellow-C'hristians, is due to theiB

who are under trouble of spirit. Sucfi dfstrem

l^low*€reatureiy wEo' ar<3 undei^ exquisite pain of body; it is a nuicb more hcia:h>u» iniquity, so to treat fellow-Christians, who are under anguish of soul''.

Again, It i» the duty of the disconsolate believer, to hope^ that h6 shall in due time, be delivered from his trouble. ^^ It is good that he should lx)th hope, and quietly wait ibr the Salvation of tlie Lord; for the Lord will not cast off for ever p." On these words of the Lord Jesus, " The very hairs of your head are all numbered,'' Austin, puts-to a believer, this pertinent question; • Thou, who canst not lose a single hair, how comes it to pass^ that thou art afraid of losing thy soul ?' Christian, cheer thy troubled spirit with tlie hope, that thy coinpa68k>natc Saviour will deliver thee, though thou canst n^t tell how, nor when *i. Let the consideration of his infinite mercy, and of his near relation to thee, encourage thee, in expectation of deliverance, to bear with patience thy grievous trial'. Consider what thou hast deserved at the hand of the Lord, and that, impatience will but provoke him, to s^t y6t a keener edge on thy trouble. Thou bast need of patience. ^< Let patience there-fere have her perfect work"*."

Moreover, It appears evident, that it is also the duty of the disconsolate Christian, neoer to give Wiy to carrwl reasoning against himself. When his feith is -Irvely, and his evidences are clear; he c«i Mfute -carnal reasoning, and say with the apostle Paal| *^ IH^ ^faall lay any thing to the charge of

Ood's elect ? It is God that jastifieth; who is he that condcmnetb ? It is Christ that died, yea, rather, that is ri^n ^gain, &c \". But when his fiuth is languid, and his evidences are eclipsed; it is not only useless, but dangerous in the extreme, to* yield to eamal reasoning about the state of his soul: for then, he is least qualified to take God^s part^ against the cavils of Satan, and of an evil heart of unbelief. Were a man, in order to try and confirm the validity of his title to ah estate, to encourage a suit to commence against himself; he surely would not choose, for that purpose, the time^ in which, he could not find his evidences of that title. Alas ! the time which a good man chooses,, for giving ear to carnal reasoning, is commonly the very tinve in which^ be hath lost hi^ evidences of grace. And it is grievous to see, with what a weak piece of sophistry, the devil will baffle him^ at such a time. It is inexpressibly dangerous for a child of light, especially when he is in the dark, to be reasofiing with the prince of darkness: he cannot, in such circumstances, t>e safe, otherwise than by the .resolute exercise of prayer, and of that faith, which is above sight, as well as contrary to sense and carnal reason. He should not spend a moment,, in framing arguments against himself*. Satan will be ready enough to suggest them... And in particular, he ought never to conclude that he is a hypocrite, from such things, as are no where in the Scripture, declared to be marks of reigning hypocrisy. Where, O disconsolate Christain, dost thou read) in the Oracles of truths That the want

o£ legal terrors in conversion ; or, that wandering thoughts^ straitness^ dulness, and deadness of spirit, in prayer, while thou bewailest them, and strivesit against them; or, that the want of present evidences of sincerity, and of those degrees of peace and joy, to which some have attained; or, that some iniquity, for a time, prevailing against thee, notwithstanding thy frequent efforts to resist itj— where, I say, dost ihou read that any of these, is an evidence of reigning hypocrisy ? Or, where canst thou find, that the presence of liypocrisy in the heart, is the same as the predominance of it ?

It is no less the duty of the disquieted believer, to disiinguis/i welif between the atheistical and blasphemous thoughts, which are injected by Satan; and those, which proceed from his own heart. His doing so, will through grace, be a mean of lessen* ing, in no small degree, the anguish of his souL Atheistical and blasphemous thoughts do sometimes proceed from his own heart: for our blessed Lord saith, *^ Out of the heart proceed evil thoughts... blasphemies ^." And he may charge liimself with such thoughts^ as having arisen from his own heart; when, instead of resisting them instantly, and with abhorrenee, he for a little, yields to them. But if, as is more frequently the case, they come in. suddenly and violently upon his mind; if his heart trembles at them, and with holy abhorrence, instantly opposes them *; and, if his being assaulted, with them,, is very grievous to him ^ ; he ought without hesitation^ to> charge them upon Satan,

and not upon himself. He should^ for his comfort, never impute them to himself, as his transgresaionsy but to the tempter, as his.

It is likewise his duty to read dilige)(tlj/f andfre^ qtietitlii/^ such passages of Scripture, as are mosS suited to comfort him. It is not less true tlian strange, that the believer, under mental trouble, is usually much disposed to read, to remember, and ■to apply to liimself, such passages of Scripture, and of human writings, as ajre most adapted to increase the trouble and terror of his soul. Such places of Scripture, and of other books, as are arousing and alarming, are indeed very proper for a good man, often to read and remember, ^hen he finds that, carnal security is prevailing against him. But ■when his soul, is already dq^ressed with terror and dismavj so that, he needs cordials to refrcsli his drooping spirit; he ought, chiefly and frequently to read, meditate, and believe with apj}lication to himself, such passages of Scripture, as are most encouraging and consoling to his fainting soul; especially these referred to at the bottom of this page^. Let him resolve firmly, in dependance on promised grace, and in defiance of his disincIiuatioDi to retad again and again, those and similar passages, to believe them with regard to himself, and to eonvert them into matter of ejaculatory prayer.

As tbe dejected bdierer, is chastened less than he deserves to be, and as it is of the Lord's mercies, that he is not even consumed ; let him readiij^ acknordcdge ihisy and see that he express his grateful sense of it, by glorifying the Lurd even in the fires*. Let him endeavour to glorify the Lord, by being constantly upon his guard, against ail manner of sin, and especially, against omitting any knowiT duty. He must never take occasion from the uneasiness of his mind, to neglect a single duly, that it is }K>ssible for him to perform. It is inexpressibly dangerous for the Christian to be indolent at any time; but especially, when he is under depression of spirit.

To conclude: Doth God afflict some even of bis own dear saints, with unuttci-able anguibh and terror of soul, when he is only chastening them for iniqirity ? What exquisite torme$U ihaij vchat dire/nl anguisA^ awaits impenitent sinners, in the place of torment, where they must lie, througliout eternity, under his vindictive, his infinite, his tremendous wrath ! Christ hath given infinite satisfaction to the offended justice of God, for all the iniquities of his children. They love God supremely: they also love his commandments, and study to keep them. They are the objects of his redeeming, of his immense, of his everlasting love; and yet, in clias-tenlng them for their iniquity, he, sometimes, af-flicteth them with dreadful impressions of his dis-^ pleasure.

^F THE NATtJRE AND TttE SIGNS OP MELAKCHOLT, WITH DIRECTIONS TO SUCH BELIEVERS AS ARB AFFLICTED WITH IT.

lyLELrAMCHOLYy tbou^h it SO weakeos and disorders the mind, as to render a person unable, to enjoy tlie comforts, and to perform the duties of life, is, nevertheless, seated in the body. But the state of body which accompanies this disease, is acknowledged by the best Pbysicians, to be in general beyond the reach of their investigation. By this distemper, the mind is so disordered, that, Jike an inflamed eye, it becomes disqualified for discerning its objects, clearly and jubtly. Ihe disease is commonly attended with gloomy thoughts, heaviness, sorrow, and fear, without any apparent cause of them. Wicked men are as liable to be afflicted with it, as good men. In the case of some, melancholy, though a bodily distemper, produces dejection of mind j in that of others, trouble of mind on spiritual accounts, especially if it be great, or of long continuance, produces the disease of melancholy in the body. Melancholy also increases trouble of mind; and trouble of mind again, increases melancholy; where they. both exist together, they mutually increase and confirm each other. How great soever, a belie-xefs grief for »w, and his dread of UvNm^ ^xi^^t^

may be; lie ought not to be called melanciioly, so long as these appear to be rational, and his imagination, to be sound. But, on the other hand, how small soever, his measure of sadness and of fear, may be; yet, if his imagination and mind, be so distempered or impaired, that he cannot assign a proper reason for his sadness and fear, nor express them in a rational manner, he is to be counted melancholy. Now, when a good man is at any time, afflicted witli this grievous distemper, it will usually discover itself, by more Or fewer of the follo^'ing signs.

S£CT. I. OfiJie signs (^mdanclidy^ espeeicU^ kn

tnse Christian,

A holy man, when he is under this monraful disease, commonly gives himself up to excessiife 'grief: he often we^s without knowing why, and thinks that he ought to do soj and if he bet appear to smile at any time, or to taHc cheerfully. Lis hesixi ^smites him for it, as if he had done amiss.

He is usually exceedingly timorous^ or JuU (^ groundless fears. Almost every thing that he sees, or hears of, serves to increase his dread; especially if fear, as often is the case, has been the primary cause of'his melancholy.

If the distemper be not deep, sadness and fei^r commonly seize him at intervals. He is. seized with fits of them, for a part of a day, or for a whole day, or even for several days together; and after some short abatement of them^ they return upon 'him; and he feels them again fastening- on his spi-•rit, without knowing why.

Tlirough the distemper of his imaginatios, he is disposed to aggravate his sin, or misery, or danger. Of every common infirmity or fault, he is ready to ipeak vfith horror, as if it were an atrocious crime: every ordinary affliction, be considers as utterly destructive; every small danger, as a great one.; every possible danger, as prolj^ble; and every probable danger, as certain.

He often thinks that, his d^y of grace is pasty and that, now it is too late for hinty to believe, to repent, or to expect mercy. Were any one to declare to him, that redeeming grace is infinitely free^'Or that the riclies of saving mercy in Christ, jKte always overflowing, or that the offers and calls of the.gospel, are directed to him in;particular; he would still affirm that, now it is too late, because his day of grace is undoubtedly past. No arguments will convince him that, to conclude that liis day of graee is past, or that God will never shew mercy nor give grace to him, while yet, God is continually beseeching him, to accept his offers of grace, and so to be reconciled to him ; is an unbelieving suspicion, that the God of truth is not sincere in his offers, and a most sinful attempt to make Him a liar ^ The Christian, dejected as he is, ought seriously to consider, how atrocious, how reproachful, how dreadful, the sin of unbelief is.

He is perpetually apprehensive that, he is uttet^ h^ forsaken by God, and is always prone to despair^ Like one who is forlorn and desolate, his conti* aual thought is, that he is undone, utterly undone.

« 1 Johav, 10*

Bat he certainly ought to consider, that sintiers who are utterly forsaken of God, are habitaally willing to continue in thehr sinful state and fram^; that they are lovers of sin, haters of holiness, andi so far as they have power and opportunity, persecutors of all who would reform them, as if they were enemies to them s—which is far indeed from being his case.

He frequently takes occasion from the doctrine oipredestination^ to despair of Divine mercy; and so, he abuses that great and fundamental doctrine. Perceiving every object, as through a coloured and distorted medium, he thinks that if the Lord hsA not elected him, it will be altogether in vain fcr him, ever to attempt believing and repenting; and then, he strongly imagines that he is not elected^ and therefore that it cannot be his duty, to hope for the mercy of God, But he would do well to recollect that, all whom God hath predestinated to the end, he hath also predestinated to the means; that, in choosing sinners to salvation, he hath chosen them to faith and repentance, not only as means, but as necessary parts, of salvation ; and that, it is his present duty, upon the warrant of the imlimited offer of the gospel, to choose Christ for his Saviour, and God in him for his God, and immediately to trust in them, for all the parts of salvation. This would, in the mean time, be a comfortable evidence to him, that God hath chosen him '. To trust in the Lord Jesus, for all his salvation, and, in the faith of offered and promised mercy, t«

^2Thw.ii. i3.

repent of all his sins, arc the way to know, that he has l)een elected to faith and repentance, as well as to every other part of salvation.

He always, asserts that he cannot believe^ and lience concludes that he cannot be saved. If any Christian friend exhort him, to come as a sinner, to the compassionate Saviour, and to trust in Him, for salvation to himself in particular; he is ready to reply, * Alas ! You seem to understand nothing f£my doleful condition ; otherwise, you would not exhort such a vile and unworthy sinner as I am, to trust that the holy One of God, would ever save bim* Indeed, it would be daring presumption in one like me, ever to attempt trusting in Him: I dare not, I will not, I cannot, confide in him, a-gainst whom I have so heinously sinned.^ His distemper, so far as it prevails, wUl not permit him to exercise failh.—A dreadful chastisement, this j for his having omitted the great duty of trusting at all times, in the only Saviour, when his imagination

was sound 1

He is, at the same time, utterly unable to exercise

joy^ or to take comfort in any thing. He cannot

comprehend, or so much as think of, any thing

which is suited to comfort him. Wiien he reads

or hears, the dreadful threatcnings of the violated

law, it is always with application of them to himself;

but when he reads or hears, the precious promises

of the blessed gospel, he either takes no notice of

them, or.says, * They do not belong to me: the

greater the mercy of God, and the riches ot his

grace, are, the more miserable am I, who have no

part in them.' He looks upon his wife, diildren,

friends, house, wealth,.and oll^ without the least

comfort; as a man would do, who is going, for his crimes, to suffer the most tormenting death. He is like a man in continual sicHness or pain, who can* not take pleasure in any thing around him, because the feeling of his incessant pain prevents him.

He never reads or hears of, any dreadful eicam* pie of Divine judgment, but he presently imagines that it will soon be his own case. If he hears ol Cain, or of Pharoah, given up to hardne^ of heart; or but reads that, some are vessels of wrath, fitted to destruction, or that, they have eyes and see not, ears and hear not, hearts and understand not; he thinks that this is his very case, or that it is all spoken of him. If he hears of any tremen-ilous judgment inflicted on one, he concludes that it will also be executed on liim: if he is told that, some person is become distracted, or has died suddenly, or died in despair; he presently thinks, that it will be so with himself. The reading of Spirals dreadful condition, has, I believe,, increased melancholy in many; the ignorant author having de» .scribed a case of the plainest, and the deepest me-lanchtrly, contracted by means of mental trouble, arising from sin committed against conscience, as if it had been the rational despair of a sound uxh dcrstanding.

He persuades himself that, none ever was in such a dismal condition, as that in which he is. Although he be ever so often told that, many of the saints have been in this very case; yet he.still persists in saying, • Never was any one's case like mine.'

His conscience is usually quicks in charging him with sin, in presenting to his view, the in-

finite punitsbment whidi he deserves for his sin, aiul in urging him on to still greater dejection of mind, as his duty. But he seems dead to all the duties, which directly tend to his consolation ; such as, prai^iQg the Lord, thanksgiving for manifold mercies, meditating on the glorious Redeemer, and on the love, the grace, and the promises of God, Press these, and such as these, ever so frequently upon him^ and he will make no conscience of them : he will regard them as duties for others, but not for him.

He is always displeased and discontented 'soith him" s^If; just as a peevish, or froward person is apt to be, with others. Is such a man hard to be picas-ed? Is he ready to find fault with every thing, which he sees or hears of; and is he offended with every one, who conies in his way ? Just so, is a melancholy man, with respect to himself: he is always suspicious of liimself, always findiag fault, always displeased with himself.

liis tliouglits, for the most part, arc turned inward upon himself* Like millstones, which grind on themselves, when they have no grain between them, his thoughts are usually employed upon themselves. When he suspects that lie has thought irregularly, he thinks again and again, on that which he has already been thinking of. He does not usually meditate much on God, (except on his terrible majesty, justice, and wrath,) nor on Christ, nor heaven, nor the state of the church, nor, indeed, on any thing without himself: his thoughts are all abstracted, and turned inward upon himself, and are such as tend, not to alleviate, but rather to increase, his perturbation. His musing on him-

-self, is chiefly, that he may perceive the working 'of Satan, in himself; diat he may find, in the de^ pravity or infirmity of his nature, as much of the hateful image of that wicked one, as he can: but the holy image of God in him, be frowardly overlooks, and will not acknowledge. And so, as noble objects of thought, raise the soul; as amiable objects, kindle love in it; as cheering objects, fill it with delight; and as God in Christ, who possesses every excdlence, doth elevate, and perfect, and make it happy; so, mean objects of thought, debase it; loathsome objects, fill it witii disgust; and mournfiil objects, impress it with sadness. To fix, therefore, his thoughts incessantly ujxffl his depravity and misery, cannot fail t© increase the sadness of bis spirit.

He commonly gives himself up to idieness; either lying in bed, or sitting unprofitably by himself:: he is much averse from labour, especially, from the work of his JisNal calling.

At the same time, he is daily harassed with Jears of want y poverty and Tnisefi/y to himself and his family; and sometimes even of imprisonment, or banishment. He is often afraid tliat some body will murder him ; and, if he but perceives any one whispering to anotlier, or winking with the eye, Jie presently suspects, that they are plotting to take away his life.

He is weafy qfcompani/y for the most part, and is much addicted to solitude.

His thoughts are commonly all perplexed^ like those of a man who is in a labyrinth, or pathlesiB wilderness, or who has lost his way in the dark. He is continually |.x)ring find groping about, and

IN A TRUE CHRISTIAN'. 169

can make out notliing, but is bewildered and entangled die more; and he is full of perple:ring karSf out of which he cannot find the way.

He is for ordinary, endless in his scruples; a-firaid lest he sin, in every thought, every word, every look; in all the food that he eats, and in all the clothing that he wears: and if he resolves to amend his ways, he is still scrupulous, with regard to his designed amendments. He dares neither ypeak, nor be silent; neither travel, nor stay at home, but scruples eveiy thing | as if his conscience were whoUy enslaved by self-perplexing scruples.

Hence it comes to pass, that he commonly ad-fficts himself much to superstzlion. He makes laws for himself, which God never made for him. He ensnares himself, by unnecessary resolutions, vows, and austerities. He places much of his religion, in outward self-imposed tasks; such as, to spend so many hours of every day, in this or that act of devotion ; to wear such and such clothes, and forbear others that are fitter for him; to forbear all sorts of food that please the taste, and such like.

He lias lost the power of governing his thought by reason. If a Christian friend exhort him, ever so earnestly and frequently, to forbear his unprofitable, self-perplexing thoughts, and to turn his mind to cheering objects, he is unable to comply. He seems to be binder a necessity, of thinking anxious and ^listracting thouglits: he cannot turn away his mind, from gloomy and frigittful ideas. He cannot meditate on < redeeming lovo, grace, or niercy. He can no more cease to muse on that,

v^hich ia already the subject of his thougtei than

■ H -^

A inaD, afflicted with a violent toothacb, can fur-* bear, at the time, to think of his pain.

Hence he usually becomes incapable, to engage in secret prayer or meditation. When he would try to pray or to meditate, his thoughts are presently thrown all into confusion. He cannot fix or keep them, upon any object without himself; for a distempered, and confused imagination, wiUi a weak reason whidi cannot govern it, is the very disease with which he is afflicted. Sometimes terror drives him from prayer. He dares not hope, and therefore dares not pray; and usually, he has not courage to receive the Lord's Supper. If he be at any time, prevailed on to receive it, he is present/jr filled with dread, fearing that, by partaking mn worthily, he has eaten and drunk judgment to himself.

The consequence is, that he begins to feel an uncommon degree of aversetiess from religious exercises. Hence he rashly concludes that, he is a hater of God and of holiness; imputing the e& fects of his bodily distemper, to his soul; while

■ yet he would rather love God, and be holy, tbari have all the riches, honours, and pleasures, in the universe. Strictly speaking, it is rather to the renewed perplexity and terror, which he experiences in those exercises, that he is averse, than to the duties themselves: for he still desires to have that calnmess of spirit, that confidence and delight in the Lord Jesus, which he would be glad to express by prayer and praise. Here we-ought to dis-tinguii^ between that degree of averseness, which is so predominant, as habituaUy, and entirely, to

•p^tiercQmc holiness in the aoul ^ and ftat degree.

ioh indeed strives vehemently against it, bu€ 38 not oveTcome it. Every holy man has some l^ee of backwardness to spiritual exercises, re* ining in him ; hat if this had dominion over 1, he would willingfy abandon them; which hm ar from being permitted ever to do. Still how-r, he may, when he is under melancholy, be sd erred from somee^r/^na/<luties, as to give them r for a time. Many real believers have, for a ion, been deterred from receiving the Sacrament lie Supper. Some of them, when under deep lancholy, and strong temptation, have even given

outward prayer, hearing, and reading of the rd of God; and yet, they have not lost Uieir de-e of holiness, which is inward prayer, nor their lire to believe, love, and obey the gospel. He is commonly occupied much, with eager and fiiciifig thoughts. He now and then feels, as if aething were speaking within him, and as if all own violent thoughts, were the impulses and adings of another. He, therefore, uses fre-mdy to attribute his irregular fancies, either to oe extraordinary motions of the Holy Spirit, or tn to some uncommon agency of Satcui. He of«

uses such expressions as these: * It was im<-

issed OD niy heart, or^ It was said to me, that £

8t do thus and thus; and soon aften^^ards I was

i, that I must not do this or that.' He con-

ves^hat, his imagination is something talking'

hin him, and saying to him, ail that he is think*

; of. '

Hence he becomes intractable and very obstinate

adhering to his own conceits. It is with the ut^

•St dffieultyi that be can be persuaded to rdSnfe

H2

quish aiiy one of tbeniy however irrational. He, at the same time, becomes peevish and froward: it iB easy to oiFend him, and difficult to please him.

It is seldom that the most convincing argumenij or that the best advice^ though pressed upon him in the most afTectionate and attractive manner, does Km any good. If a Christian friend tries to persuade him, that, he has some evidences of a work of grace begun in his soul, and so far succeeds, as to lessen, in a small degree, the dejection ef his mind $ yet, as soon as he again views.-his heart and life, tlirough the medium of his perturbing humours, every such argument and advice is forgotten, and he is as far from serenity of mind, as ever* Any encouraging thought of his state, to whid^ one can be the taeans of helping him, seldom codp' tinues above a (i^y- or two.

When his melancholy becomes deep, he is id** most constantly troubled with Iiideous and blasphfr-inous temptaturnsy against God, or Christ, or the Scripture, gr the immortality of the soul. These SLYise partly from his own fears, which make him think most of that, of which he is most afraid to think. The very uneasiness, occasioned by his fears, attracts and confines his thoughts to that which he dreads. As lie who is over desirous jo( sleeping, and is fearing that he shall not sleep, is Ukelyto continue awake, because his desire and fear keep liim waking i so the fears and anxieties of him who is melancholy, do counteract themselves. But these temptations arise chiefly from Satan, who seizing the opportunity of the Christian's beiog under that disease, .vexes him, and tempts himi to blasphemous [Aougbts, FoTy as that crafty and malipious ejoe-

iriy of the saints, knows that, he can more easily and successfull}', tempt a melancholy saint, to unbelieving, despairing, and blasphemous thoughts, than any other saint; so, when permitted, he will be sure, vehemently to instigate him to such thoughts. Hence a good man, when he is under strong melancholy, often feels, as if something within him, was forcibly urging him to utter some blasphemous, or sinful expression; and he can have no rest, unless he yield to the temptation : but no sooner docs he yield, than he is tempted utterly to despair, because he has committed so heinous a sin: and when Satan has gained this advantage over him, he still, to increase his dejection of spirit, sets it before him. It is wonderful, what extraordinary acuteness, the Christian, under this grievous distemper, will discover, in evading the force of the strongest arguments, that can be urged for his comfort: but I believe that Satan is, on such occasions, permitted to suggest his answers to him^ and to assist him in setting them in the strongest light possible.

Upon the tempter's gaining that advantage oyer bim, he further prompts him to conchide, that he has been guilty of the sin against the Holif Spirit^ which will never be forgiven him. This increases his despair of mercy. The man who indeed commits that hon*ible sin, must be a pix)fessed infidel^ and that in opposition to confessed miracles. And yet the melancholy believer det^pairs, because he dresids that he has. committed that sin; though, perhaps, he neither imderstands what it is, nor has any reason, but his own groundless fear, or some blasphemous temptation which he auhors^ iot \s&fl^

Jtl3

gining tliat he has been guilty of it Alas! he does not consider that^ a temptation is one thing, and a sin, another; and that, no man has less^ cause to fear, that he shall be condemned for his transgression, than he who abhorreth sin most, and is least willing to commit it: (or no man can be less willing to commit iniquity, than the Christian •aflSictcd with melancholy, is, to be guilty of those blasphemous and hideous thoughts, of which fie bitterly complains.

When a good man, under deep melandioly, has been long harassed with suggestions to blasphemy and despair, he at length begins to dready thafc Itf is possessed hy Satan* A man may be said tir be possessed by Satan, when that enemy is at my time permitted to exercise, in a certain measure, his power on him; and that, by a stated and effieo tual operation, either on his soul, or on his body. The devil thus possesses the souls of the ungodly'f; but he is never permitted for a single mom^2t,ljiu*' to possess those of the suints. But, tliough ke ^aa-not possess the souls of any of the saints ;. yet he may, as in the case of Job, be suffered to possess for a season, the bodies of sonje of tliem. He may,, perhaps, in tlic hand of the Lord, be an instrument of inflicting, among other distempers, the disease of melancholy on them ; and ho may also, by harassing them with horrible and de£{)airi3ig 8Ug« gestions, be an instrument of increasing that grievous disease. But let it still be remembered by the dejected believer, that Satan's exercising for a season, such power on the body, as may be ifcrmed a

* Ejh. ii. z.

possession of it; is no sign at all, of an unregcncr-ate state, or of bis having gained possession again of that soul, from which, he had, in the day of regeneration, been cast out. StiU, however, as this malicious and cruel enemy, often raises a storm of persecution against the Christian, from without; so, in proportion as the Lord perniitteth him, he likewise produces trouble within. It should also be regarded by the disconsolate saint, as matter of unspeakable comfort; that, of all men, none loves the sin under which he siglis, less than he does, £>r it is the heaviest burthen of his soul; and that^ BO «B evinceth Satan's possession of a soul, but fliat which the man loves, more than he hates, flind which he would rather keep, than forsake. Tlie melancholy Christian should likewise, for his encouragement, recollect that, God will charge his femptations, only upon Satan himself, and nowise QpoB him, so long as he receives them not, by the teaaaent of his will, but continues to abhor them i ind that, he will no more condemn him, for those tfvil'effi^cts, which, produced by tlic force of a bodi-fy disease, are unavoidable; than he will condemn a man, for raving thoughts or words, in a strong fever or delirium ^. But, so far as reason in the dejected Christian, yet has power, and his understanding, the government of his passions; it is doubtless his own fault, if he do not exert himself in using that power, though the great difEculty of using it, renders his fault the less.

If his melancholy become very deep, the dgected -believer often imagines that he Jjcafs voices,,and^

*» Ps. ciil. 13, 14.

sees lights and apparitions^ or that something meets him, and sajs this or that to him; when ally i» but the error of a diseased imagination and an impaired intellect.

In consequence of the continued, and harassing perplexity of his mind, under strong melancholy* the dejected Christian becomes weaty even of his life. Some, under deep melancholy, are strongly temptetl to make away with themselves j and tlicy are assaulted with the temptation, so incessantly, and so forcibly, that they can go no where, hut t*iey feel, as if somewhat within were instigating them.vehemently, and saying, * Doit.' For the grievous disease, under which they labour, will permit thbm to feel nothing, but anguish and despair, and to say nothing, but that they are forsaken^ and miserable, and undone. It not only makes them weary of their lives, even while they are sore afraid to die; but it affords Satan a s|iecial opportunity, to urge them to destroy themselves: so that, if they by themselves, happen to be crossing oiri a bridge, he urges them to leap into the water; 'if they when alone, see a knife, or any other des-tiHictive weapon, he instigates them to kill themselves with it; and they usually feel, as if some-tliing within them, were importunately urging, them, saying, * Do it, do it instantly.' Hence some of them, begin secretly to contrive how they rnay accoiiiplish it j yea, and so far yield to the importunity of the tempter, as actually to destroy themselves. This undoubtedly would be self-murder, were it not that, the doleful distemper, under, which they labour, so impairs their undcrstandinjji

as to render tliem at the time, incapable to resists the horrible temptation.

Although the use of means, for the preservation and recovery of Christians, afflicted with melancholy, belongs as much to others connected with them, as to themselves j yet, so far as it is possi* ble for themselves to exercise their reason, they must be warned, 1. To abhor all such temptations, and not for a moment, to give place to them, in their minds; 2. T'o az-oid car.^fuUij all occasions of yielding to them ; so*as not to go near a river, or any instrument, which, Satan would instigate thenr to use for that purpose; S. And, to tnake Anouon their case without delay, to some of their Christian friends; in order that, suitable means may be employed for their preservation, and restoration to health:^'

Pfnally, The dejected Christain, after all, will not believef that he is under the disease of melancholy; but will be displeased, if he hear any friend so niuch as hint it to him; and will affirm that, it is but the rational sense^ of his extreme misery, or, of being utterly forsaken by God, and of lying under his terrible wrath. It is therefore with no small difficulty, that he can be persuaded, to observe the prescriptions and directions of a Physi-cian^- or to employ any means whatever, for the cure of his bodily disease f asserting that his body is in perfect health, and that it is only his soul that is troubled K These arey for the most part, the signs of melui-

with melancholy.

If the disease has proceeded &r, or become strong, directions to those Christians themselves, are commonly to little purpose; because their minds are so weakened, that they cannot comply with them. But, because in some, especially, when the distemper has but lately begun to seize thenr, there is some power of understanding, and of reason, still remaining; I shall ofier them, the following directions and advices;

1 • Endeavour to widerstand weU, the covenatU of grace. Study, without delay, to attain just and clear views of the infinite riches, suitableness, and freeness, of the grace of that everlasting covenant* The better you understand, and the more you think of, that wonderful contract, in which, complete salvation is purchased, promised, and sure to you ^ the more, under the consoling influences of the ■Spirit of grace, will your souls be sust^ined^ and your tempers be sweetened. Think atofteaof the

righteousness of Jesus Christ, as of your own sinfulness $ as often of his fulness of grace, as of your own emptiness of grace; and as frequently of the boundless love, grace, and mercy, of youi^ Cove-nant-God, as of his majesty, holmess, and justice* The way to diminish, and even to overcome those terrors, whicU arise from partial, and false appre* hensions of God, is, to attain spiritual, clear, and enlarged views of Him, as a God whose glory it-is,., to be merciful and gracious even to the chief of sinners; and who will certainly shew mercy to them, who unfeignediy desire to honour him, and to be eternal debtors to his redeeming grace, for ail their salvation. . Let your thoughts also dwell Wk these cheering truths; That the Lord Jesus liatfa, according to that well-ordered and sure co*-venant, given such an infinite satisfaction to Divine justice, for your sins, as secures you from eternal death; that he hath performed such a perfect obedience to the Divine law, as merits for you eternal life; and^ that life eternal is to you, the m«-finitely free gi/i of God K

2. Be^rmly persuaded^ that the incarnate Re-d^mer, with his righteousness and fulness, is, in the gospel, offered to you e^ sinners of mankind* * Constantly believe not only that, Heisableatid willing to save you; but that, by his eternal Fath--er and himself, he is freely, wholly, and particularly, offered to yon ^ Believe cordially the record^ ** that God giveth to youy eternal Ufe, and that' this life ht in his son °^."

It would be presumption in any of the fallen angels, to trust in I^im for their salvation, because he is not offered ^to them; but it is not presumption in you, but a duty, to confide in him for all your salvation*;- because the offer, the call, and the conmiandment to believe in him, are directed to you, in eommoa with all other hearers of the gospel $ and these a& ibrd you a right, at all tinges, to place the confidence of your hearts in him for graee and glory. Believe then that, seeing you have an ample waF^* ranty to trust confidently in the Saviour for the whole of your salvation, it cannot be your sin but your duty, lOur principal duty to do so.- O if ye but saw, in the light of his word and Spirit, and believed, your Divine warrant, to come as you are, to come at all times, and confide in the Lord Jesug for complete salvation;—how greatly would it alle-iviate the trouble of your minds ^ I

that, he will not deceive your confidence, rior dis--appeint your expectation. Ah ! if a faithful and -able friend but suggest, that you may depend on' him for relief, in some external difficulty, ye will most readily confide in him, and believe that he will not deceive you ; and yet, you cannot trust a faithful, an almighty Redeemer, though he com* mandeth you to do it, and promiseth ** that lie will not turn away from you, to do you good *•"

exc^t when ye can have the world along with him! O watch diligently^ against the inordinate love of earthly things i for it will dispose you to indulge distracting care, and repining opposition of spirit, to the holy disposals of adorable providence. It is anxious care, and peevish discontent, that are often, at first, the occasions of melancholy. They usually so disturb a man's mind, m to render it defenceless against those temptations, respecting the state of his soul, with which Satan will aftei wardt^ assail him. The disquietness, which hath been occasioned by outward crosses, is then removed to his conscience, and so inflames it, that he begins to be for a long season, oppressed with many fears about the salvation of his soul. Thus, as if the Lord had not afflicted him enough, he adds to his own affliction. Only consider how heinous a sin it is, so,to love the world, as to set up your own wills, in opposition to the holy will, and providence of the Most High. By repining against Him, you secretly accuse him, and by accusing him, ye blaspheme his worthy name. Consider that, the resignation of your wills in every thing, to the will of God, is a principal branch of hoUness; and that, it is in proportion as ye take complacency in His blessed will, that your hearts are comforted. O be persuaded to trust firmly that, God in Christ loveth you and bestoweth Himself upon you, as your everlasting portion; and that, the Lord Jesus will give you that which is goodf and withhold no good thing from you: for that is the way, through the Spirit, to mortify, the inordinate love of the world.

5, Be net sdlilmyy but n& little and as seldom W {Kbssible. A time for retiretn^nt from companyis^ itidted, to those Christians i^ho are well, a season of the greatest value for meditJition, self examination, and prayer; but to yoiiy it is a season of great danger. If the devil, with His temptations, as^ saultcii Christ himself, when he found Him in a wilderness, r^mfte from company; much nrore will he assail you, if he find you solitary. It is your' dirty therefore to be, as often as attention to your other duties will permit,* in the company of humble, faithful, and clieerful Christians; especially, of those whose views of the gospel are clear, whose faith is strong, and who can speak from experience, of deliverance from dejection of spirit. It may also be of advantage to you, if ye confer at a time, even with Christians, whose cases are similar to your own; in order to be satisfied, that your condition is far from being singular.

6. Recollect frequently that, although it is a sia to yield to a temptation ; yet, it is not a sin to be tempted. Jesus Christ himself, ^* was in all points tempted like las we are, yet without sin **.'' H^ was tempted to the most atrocious and horrible sins, yea, even.to fall down and worship the devil; and yet, having with perfect abhorrence resisted every temptation. He still was without sin. You can at no time, be tempted to more horrible iniquities, than those to which, the holy One of God uras tempted. Though you cannot endure tempta* tion without sin^ as He coukl; yet, as it is not

" £Ub, vv, i5%

every-sinful inclination in the heart of a believer^ thflt is to be considered as a compliance with d temptation, ye should not charge upon yourselves, that which is the sin only of the tempter.

7. Consider how much it giatifies Satan^ to see you indulging gloomy and despondent thoughts. It pleases that gloomy spirit exceedingly, to perceive you sollen and melancholy, like himself; to behold you distrusting your Saviour, and suspecting your God to be an enemy to you, and that, under the pretence of being deeply humbled and grieved for your sins. That surely cannot be, either your duty, or your ornament, which gratifies the devil, and serves to promote the interests of his kingdom. That can be no honour to you, which robs your gracious God and Father, of the honour of his redeeming grace; and which disposes you to hate him, and to flee from his presence,' as if he was your implacable enemy,

8. Meditate frequently on the promises and grace of the gospel j but let each of your meditations, be short and easy. A deep and continued meditation, will but harass and perplex your minds, and render you the more unable to perform your other duties. Your imagination and mind are, at present, so weakened, that you cannot employ them in a fixed and protracted meditation, without increasing thereby your malady. Do not mistake my meaning: I am not directing you to neglect meditation, especially on consoling subjects, but, to forbear deep and iong meditation ; because, in your present condition, it will strengthen your painful distemper. A short meditation on some cheering subject, ma^

be a mean of lessening, and even of remo?ing, jour dejection; whereas, a deep and continued meditation will distract you, and by increasing your dis* ease, will render you the less able, to perform the other duties incumbent on you. When ye are at any time meditating^ do not look down into the gloomy dungeon of your own heart, where, at present, nothing can be seen but darkness or confusion ; but look away from yourselves, 16 the compassionate Redeemer, and to God, as a God of infinite grace in Him. Instead of poring on your own hearts, to discern if love to Christ be there i you ought rather to be thinking of the infinite loveliness of Christ, and of bis love to you. Tbi^ would be the means, of exciting the exercise ai your love to him, and of bringing it forth to your vievr. A sight of your own hearts, will but render you the more melancholy; whereas, a beKev^ ing view of the glorious grace of the Redeemeri will comfort you. Frequent thoughts of the Lamb of God, who loved you, and gave himself for you, and of the love and mercy of God in Him, would, through the Holy Spirit, produce sweetness and love in your hearts ; when, on the contrary, fixed thoughts of siii, and of the wrath of God, would beget bitterness and aversion of spirit from him.

9. Be frequently employed in ejaculatory prayer^ and let your stated prayers be shorter than ordinary. In your present case, you are not able, to continue in these holy exercises, so long as formerly. Since therefore ye cannot do as ye would, ye should do as you can. If sickness or pain of body, excuses a man for being short in devotional duties, because vntuvQ is then so debilitated,, that it cannot hold out

long; the si etnw flf die natimJ spirits, which cd-feeUes, not <iiilj the bodjy but also the mind, may w^ excuse him. When ve fed TonnelTcs on-able to oontiniie loi:^ in prayer, as ye cannot miss to doy struggle not too hard, in opposition to enfeebled nature; fin- this, by increasing your distemper, win disable yoo the more for eroy duu*. Study at the same time to retain, as much as possible, your rdids finr h<4y exercises; and to guard against every thing, that would render them troublesome^ or grievous to you. Let not your pre-Beaat inability, to ccmtinue so long in prayer as formerly, discourage you; for this also would increase your malady. Endeavour, when you are praying, to employ ua much of the time, in thankful acluiow-Jeilgem^t of mercies, as in penit^it confession of sins* Were ye to employ, even more of the time, in thanksgiving and praise, than, in confession and coniplaint; it might, under the influ«ices of the blessed Comforter^ be a mean of lessening, or even of removing, the bitterness of your spirits.

10. Be not discouraged, though in your holy exercises you have no lively feelings, nor elevating conceptions. These, however desirable and useful they are, yet cannot, in your present condition, be reasonably expected. Although they are sometimes enjoyed by many holy persons, yet they ore not the essentials of true holiness. Lively feelings, depend more on one's natural constitution, tliau many are willing to allow. Some Christians have naturally a quicker sensibility, than others. A very imaU affair will make some of them, feel deeply. They who live nearest to God, are commonly not those, who hav^ the liveliest feelings and emotiou;^

of joy or grief J but those, who are most jconforiil-^ ed to the holy image of the Son of God, and wbo, from principles of faitii and love, are most devoted to Him, and most inclined, at all times, to do his will. Many believers, e&pecially when dejected in spirit, have bewailed bitterly, their want of deep feelings i who, if their feelings had been but in the smallest degree, deeper or livelier, than they already were, might have been disordered, and even distracted by them.

II. Be diligent J from principles of faith and love, in dcing the work of your lawful calling. Be con^ stantly occupied, as far as your bodily strength will permit, in. doing seasonably, your proper workj and consider that it is very sinful, as well as dangerous, to squander any part of your precious time in idleness. The Lord bath commanded you, to labour six days; and therefore, you cannot neglect prosecuting your secular business, without omitting your duty, and thereby incurring, in a still higher degree, the displeasure of your heavenly Father. Besides, if ye allow yourselves, but for a short season, to be unemployed, Satan will be sure to find employment for you. By being idle, you invite him both to tempt and to trouble you j and he will not fail, instantly to seize an opportunity, s© very favourable to his design. Then, ye will have leisure to hearken to him, and to revolve in your minds, every one of his infernal suggestions. Your precious time is continually hasting away, and the Lord hath allowed you none to consume in idle^ oess. If then, you, notwithstanding, allow yourselves to squander any part" of it in sloth; you JQAjK th^rehy provoke the Lord to permit Satai^

4o harass you in a very uncommon degree. - No pretence of employing your time in exercises of devotion, wiil excuse your idleness; for you are omitting that duty, which the holy law of God re-

; quires *• Besides, you should consider that, to ejnploy your time as formerly, in the work of your lawful vocation, especially if it be in the open air, will probably be a most effectual mean of curing you of your bodily distemper. , 12. Represent your case to some skilful, cheer-fiil, and humble Minister or private Christian, sndyallaw diligeiUly his directions. Your imagination is cso distempered, and your mind is so weakened, that you cannot judge aright, either of your condition, or of your dutj% Your diseased imagination wilJ represent every object to your jnind, in dark and frightful colours. Relate your case, therefore, to some skilful and fnitliful coun-

■ sellor J especially, to one who himself was once in your afflicted condition; and do not despise his judgment concerning, either your dejection, or the means to be used for the removal of it. Be directed by him, with respect to the subjects of your thoughts, the objects of your fears, the scruples of your consciences, and the manner of your devotional exercises. ** Be not wise in your own conceits." Do not obstinately adhere to every fancy, that strikes your minds ; but, distrusting your own understandings, follow resolutely the directions of Sifi experienced, and dieerful Christian. This is prescribed .by the Spirit of God ; and he will bless Jhis own ordinance 5^.

IS. If you have reason to apprehend, tbat your malady is increasing^ ye ought to consult a skilful. Physician; and, in the hope that you shall in due time recover, to observe carefully his prescriptions* Since the body is afflicted as well as the mind, yoa should, m order to a removal of your dejection, follow the directions of the Physician, as well as of the Divine. This is one of the duties required of you, in the sixth commandment of the moral law. Indeed, until the disease of the body be in some degree removed, it cannot be reasonably expected, that the mind will be relieved.

14. Finally, Trust that the Lord Jesus, whose infinite compassions fail not, will, as far as it shall be for his glory and your good, command delivei^" ance for you. ** Though," for a season, ** he cause grief, yet will he have compassion, according to the multitude of his mercies ^." Instead of trusting in the means, which it is still your duty diligently to use, trust in your infinitely compassionate Saviour ; and, in the exercise of humble confidence in Him, let each of you say, " He will turn again, he will have compassion upon me * f' ** Thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance '^.'*

Sect. III. Advices to the relations and friends of such Christians J as are (tfflicted with melancholy.

It will now be proper, to subjoin some advices to those relatives and friends of Christians under mdancholy, who are often in their company, and to whom it belongs to take care of them.

2 Lam. III. 32. ° Mic. vii. 19. * Ps. xxxli. 7*

CHRISTIANS AFFLICTED WITH MELANCHOLY. 191

I. I would counsel you to regard them, at all times, with the most tender compassion. Of all the maladies to which, persons in this valley of tears, are liable, melancholy is die most dismal and overwhelming. Other distempers seize the boiiy only ; but this fastens on, both the body and the mind «t once. It disquiets a man's mind, disorders his thoughts, and fills his soul with anguish and horror. Look then on such Christian friends, as are under this dreadful distemper, with the greatest pity and tenderness. Considering that, ye your-v selves are also in the body, and are obnoxious to the same overwlielining malady, regard them with the most affectionate and tender sympathy. They are de^ly afflicted in body, and sore vexed in spirit. Their minds are troubled. Their spirits are dgected. Their consciences are iuflamcd. Their sighs are deep. The language of their doleful condition, especially to yon, is the same as that of Job, to his friends;—*' Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends j for the hand of God hath touched me ^J'

2. Pray frequently andjeroenily to the Lord for them, and request other Christians, to pray for them likewise. In presenting your supplications for them, you have strong arguments to plead. Ye may plead, that the Lord Jesus endured unparalleled anguish of soul, as well as torment of body, for them ; that their trouble is so great and overwhelming,, that none but He, can help or deliver them I that tlie more insupportable, their anguish .and terror are, the more illustriously, will his

power and mercy be displayed, in delivering t}iem ; that the more dismal and formidable their distress is, the more gloriously will the kindness of his love be manifested, in creating peace to their troubled souls; and that the less others can-do, to relieve them, and the more unworthy of relief they are, the more brightly, will the glory of hia redeeming grace^ shine, in saving them. And though they may, under deep despondency and terror, even forbid you to pray any more for thera j yet persist you still, in sending up your supplications to the Father of mercies, in their behalf, and in requesting others to do the same: for, if the LcH*d stir up you and his saints around you, to continue instant in prayer for them, he will, in dne season, " stir up his strength, and come and save them **." The Lord Jesus saith to his disciples, ** If two of you sliall agree on earth, as toucliing any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them, of my Father which is in heaven */* Accordingly, when many of the saints were gathered together, and employed in praying for Peter, who was kept in prison ; the Lord delivered him, at the very time in which, they were presenting their sujv plications for his deliverance ^

3. St tidy frequently to suggest groimds of comfort to them, by telling them especially, that the Lord can, and that you trust he will, shortly deliver therru Endeavour often to revive their drooping spirits, by reminding them that the Father oi mercies can in a moment, command deliverance for them \ and that ye hope, *^ He will satisfy them

Encourage them likewise, by repeating daily to them, that many others^ave been ia as deep anguish, as thqr are; and yet have afterwards, be^i -made to rgoice in the light of God's countenance. By encouraging discourse like this, you may, by the blessing of God, give them ^ome faint hope of deliverance^ which will alleviate their doleful trouble, and con-flcle their wounded spirit.

4w Often remind them, of the infinitely rich and iree grace of the Lord Jesus, of his being in the gospel freely and wholly offered to them, and of ihe ample warrant afforded them by the offer, to trust in him, for all salvation to themselves in particular. Exhort -them daily, to come as they are, ^ come as sinners in themselves, and to intrust the whole of their salvation to Jesus Qirist. Put them oflen in mind, that tlHs is tl>eir first, tlieir principal duty; and, that their neglecting of this, is their greatest sin \ Urge them daily, to trust that the JLord Jesus lovetli them, with a free, an immense, and an everlasting love ; and that be will surely bestow upon them, all the salvation that he offereth to them. Remind them frequently, that God in Christ is infinitely merciful and gracious 4 that as the heaven is higher than the earth,

80 his thoughts of mercy and grace, are higher than their thoughts of guilt and dnworthiness, of misery and despondency; Mid that the very chief of sinners have been$ and still may be, pardoned and received into his favour. The greatest kind-Bess, that you can shew them, next to prajring for them, is, to set the consoling truths of tibe gos-pd often before them: for thescy in the hand of the adorable Comforter, are fitter than any thing else, to comfort them.

. 5. Do not relate in their hearing, any mourn/id or frightjtil tale: for if they hear a doleful stoiy, their diseased imagination is prepared to fasten upon it, and thereby to increase the sadness d their spirit. The hearing of a melancholy tale, will throw them into a still more violent pertur* bation of mind 5 and so, will strengthen their dole-fcrl malady. They are commonly very acute, in exaggerating every dismal story, and in turning it to their own prejudice; so that, when they read «r hear any sad and shocking narrative, they will not fail to say withm themselves, * If it is so grie^ vous, so terrible, to be treated with such' severitj', stfch barbarity 5 how miserable, how dismal, how dreadful, must our condition be, when we have a sin-avenging God, for.our infinite enemy, and have no prospect, but that of being tormented in fire and brimstone, for ever and ever !' Their hearts already meditate terror; and therefore every sad account which they happen to hear, increases their terror. It pours oil into the flame. Study tbdiif as much as possible, never to mention befoicc them, any thing that would add to their mental trouble. ft When you converse with them> upon reli-

gioas subjects, do ftot ^re^^ upon their minds ^tidl tx)n8ciences, the Icpm as a eovenant of works. The law in its covenantHform, should be set before believers, as well as before others; but not before such believers, as are i^Sicted with deep melancholy* To set the fiery law, more and more home to tb«n, when they are already overwhelmed, by a aense of contracted guilt, and by a dread of eternal wradi; is indeed the way to inflame, but not to Ileal, the wounds of their consciences. The law as a rule, indeed, ought frequently to be urged upcxi them; but not the iaw as a broken covenant. They are already much cast down; and they should rather be lifted up^ by the comforts of the gospe]> than cast down still lower, by the terrors of the violated law.

7. Do not, at any time, speak to them 2>2 a harsh w passionate strain. Bitter words will do them no good, but will, on tlie contrary, mflame their wounds, and so increase their anguish. If you de* sire to be instrumental, in alleviating th^ir sorrows, and in removing their sadness; do not, on any pretence whatever, irritate their minds by rugged speecJies. To rebuke or upbraid them now, when they are least able to bear it, will but imbit-ter their wounded spirits, and so add to their dejection. Do not say to them, That they complain without a cause; for they would not complain, if their hearts were not perplexed, by the terrors of the Almighty. Besides, if ye be harsh in your speeches to them, they will begin to suspect, that ye have qo kindness for them, no sympathy with them; and consequently, they will disregard al-

most every thing that you say to them. Job, kk answer to the severe speeches of his three friends, said to them, " Miserable comforters are ye alL If your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap .up words against you, and shake my head at you. But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief ^;" The enemies of Messiah are, in ancient prophecy, thus characterized: ** They talk to the grief of those, whom thou hast wounded •^." Let not the behaviour of your dejected friends, then, provoke you at any time, to anger against them j. nor let any of their expressions, ever make you speak passionately or harshly, to them.

8. Believe that, their griefs and fears ^re smky as they say that they are. When you talk with them, believe that, their words are a true expression of their thoughts and feelings; and do not <:onlradict them. Be not so cruel as to say, in answer to -any of their doleful complaints, as some have said; < It is but a mere whim, an odd freak, -a strange fancy.' If it is but a fancy, a distempered imagination is, at least, as real, and as grievous an affliction, as any other calamity; and the persons afflicted with it, require, at least, to be treated with as tender sympathy, as they do, who are under any other, how great soever it may be. Do not think that they affect to be more sad, than they really are. They are under such perturbation of spirit, that they need not, and will not, and -cannot, counterfeit any more sadness or anguish^ ^han that which they already feel. If you do nojt

appear to them, to credit what they say; it will not be in their power to believe, that your concerir for them, or sympatiiy with them, is real. And when they find that it is to no purpose, to disclose the anguish of their souls to you, they will suppress it J and then, it will overwhelm them, and so increase the disease of their natural spirits. If then, you have the smallest desire, to be instrumental in relieving your afflicted friends, do not disbelieve, nor contradict them; but shew them invariably, that you believe their doleful complaints, to be true expressions of the anguish which they fi^l.

9« Study as far as, consistently with a good con-^ sdence, ye can, to please them in every thing, and^ not to do, nor say, any thing that may displease them. To irritate them, will but disquiet and per*' plex them the more, and so will increase their dis«-temper ; whereas, to please them in every thing,. and in every way possible, will be one of the most efiectual means of curing them. If you know what it is that, in any degree, disgusts them, let it-be removed without delay; and if you can conscientiously do,^ or say, or afford, any thing which-ye know would gratify them, do not withhold it» from them. This indeed will not be an easy task: for to be gloomy*, or apt frequently to be displeased, forms no small part of their distemper. But you ought carefully to study it: for if ye could frequently please them, it might, by the Divine blessing, be a mean of arresting the progress of their doleful malady, if not, of removing it in process of • time altogether.

iheir grievous distemper renders them unable to dow They iire under great depression, and anguish of sfpirh^ and are continually fuH of perplexing thoughts. It would then be very unkind, and even cruel, to urge them vehemently, to do any thing which requires exertion of mind, or intenseness of thought. If you importune or press them, to do that which, in their present condition, they are no more capable of performing, than a man whose bones are broken, is, of running a race, or of walking under a burden ; ye will thereby, throw them into still deeper perturbation of sjMrit, and this will increase their malady. If the distemper has not yet advanced far, you may indeed, if necessajry, often exhort them to do any thing that can easily be done, and to engage in the exercises of seoiid and public worship ; but even this must be donci not in a peremptory, but in a gentle and a£Pea-tionate manner.

11. At the same time, do not if possible suftr them to be habittuilly idiej or to be long alone. Endeavour, with loving and mild importunity, to allure them to some agreeable and easy task; such as will exercise thie body, and yet not require exertion of mind. This will contribute^ not only to j^trengthen the body, but, in some degree, to vsjith-draw the attention of the mind, from its disquieting thoughts.

12* To eonekide: choose such a Physician for them, as is eminently skilled in curing the disease of melancholy ; and, at the same time, is piident and cautious. If one can be found, who has himself^ in any degree, been afflicted with that grievous malady, and who has, by the blessing of God, cured some who had been under it; he should, in preference to any other, be consulted | and his prescriptions and directions ought to be so carefully observed, as even in cases of extremity to force, if it cannot be otherwise attained, the afflicted persons to comply '•

Fbom what has been advanced in this Chapter, it will) I hope, be obvious to the intelligent and candid reader, that true religion is neither thecause^ nor the effect of melancholy.

It cannot be the cause of melancholy; for many, have been, and many are, truly religious, who have never appeared, in the smallest degree, to be under-the disease of melancholy. Were genuine religion the cause of melancholy, it would undoubtedly have been so, in the case of all, who have exhibited satisfactory evidences of their godly sincerity, livery religious man, would inevitably be affllicted with that dreadful malady; yea, he would be oppressed with it, usually in the very degree, in which he is religious.

has Biost effctually cured even of deep melan^ choly. Peace with Crod, and peace of conscience together with the exercise of supreme love to God, have, in many instances, removed deeply-rooted melancholy, and.thatj after it had resisted all the power of medicines. Joy and peace in believing have, by the Divine blessing, often dSected the cure, without the help of medicines j especially in those cases in which, the melancholy constitution of the body, had been produced by trouble of mkid. True religion, then, when it has its due effect upon the heart, is so far from bemg the cause, that it is the best cure^ of melancholy.

As religion is not the cause, so neither is it^e effict of melancholy. Were true religion the e£^ of melancholy, every melancholy man would be come truly religious, and his degree of, genuine xellgton, would be in exact' proportion to his degree of melancholy; so that, the more aC flicted with that direful malady, he were, the more joy and peace in believing, and the more love to God, and delight in him, would he at the same time experience^ But instead of this, it appears in fact, that the greater number of those who are under the disease of melancholy, consists of persons who are entire strangers, yea, and some of them avowed enemies, to true religion; Faitfa^ holiness, and spiritua^ comfort, which constitute real religion, are so far from being the effects of melancholy, that the disease of melancholy is, in itseltj a great hinderance to them. It is true that, the Lord may render this dreadful malady, subser* vient to faith, holiness, and comfort, a3 he some-times doth, legal terror*, but botK the one and the

Other are, in themselves^ obstnictions to thenar Melancholy, indeed, effects slavish fears, legal terrors, and endless scruples; but these constitute no part of pure religion: for, in proportion as religion is increased, in the heart and life of the believer, these are diminished. To say, then, either that; genuine religion makes persons melancholy, or that, melancholy renders people truly religious; is to utter an ignorant, ainl ai> impudent slauder, a* gainst our holy religion.- No man who has thfc smallest experience of Godliness, can deliberately. reproach it in that manner. Some of the saints, it is granted, are sometimes melancholy $ but this is not, because they, are religious; but either, because they^find, that they have too little of religion, or, because they fear, that they have none at aiH Melancholy, therefore, instead of being styled, relt'gi" ouSy should rather, I humbly apprehend, be termed, superstitious melancholy : for while, this distemper makes no man truly religious, it has a direct tendency to render all who are afflicted with it, whe« ther they be converted, or unconverted, superstitious "».

Hence, the devout reader may also learn that, so much doth the direful disease of melancholy, weaken the mind of a holy man, while be is under it j that he not only cannot, but will fwty be sensible of joy, or of any other grace in himself. So fai' as that doleful malady prevails, it renders him sullen, and averse from seeing, or feeling, or attending to, any thing which might afibrd him comfort It makes bim willing, to despond, and unwilling to '

ancholy is, it is infinitely more desirable^ even to'be a melmicholy saint, than a mad sinner. Solomon, ivho could not be mistaken, informs us, wheai speaking of unregenerate sinners, that^ *^ madness is in tbeir heart while they live \*' Now suppos-mg, (which very seldom haf^>i^s,) that a holy man should be afflicted with mdaneholy, all his day»; still, it is infinitely less dreadful, to have that direful malady aifecting the mind, during the short period of human life, and then, followed by endless and inefiable delight; than to have that madness in the heart whilst one lives, which afterwards, will increase into hideous smd endless rage. Impenitent sinners, like Saul of Tarsus, are << mad against the saints P;" and ^< ^ey are mad upcxi their idols ^/* The prodigal, under conviction of his sin and misery, is said to have " ecmie to himself ';" which intimates, that hitherto he had beoi beside himself. Unregenerate men, with respect to the concerns of their souls^ are madmen; and all their joys, are but like the pleasant dreams of a mas, who has been deprived of his understanding: whereas, those regenerate men, who are under the deepest melancholy, have still the principle and the habit of pure^ solid, and everlasting joy.

J HS throne o( tbe iacompFehenfiible, and only wise God, ^' is established in righteousness; but it is» at the same time, surrounded ^^ with clouds ftnd thick darkness." *^ He maketh darkness his pavilion round about him**^ ^^ His judgments are a great deep:" they are too deep for us to fathom. His counsels are unsearchable, and his ways of providence are past finding out. When, therefore, we would try to penetrate into the mysterious de-Mgns, which the infinitely wise God hath, in permitting any of his redeemed, so to lose their spiritual consolation, as to &11 imder spiritual trouble, and even sometimes under melancholy; it becom-eih us to do it, with the most profound reverence, and only so far, as the holy Scriptures are our • guide. Now firom these, we discover that the Lord sufFereth believers, to deprive themselves of their sensible comfort, and to continue for a season, under trouble of mind^ not in order that they may thereby, give the smallest degree of satbfisction to his justice, for their sins. Their Divine Surety hath endured for them, the wkole punishment due tor all their iniquities; and sq, hath fully satisfied the offended justice of Jehovah '^ We also find that, he doth not permit this, from any pleasure that he taketh in their pei^lexity of soul» consider-

ed merely in itself: for His nature is so iniSnitely merciful, that he can take no pleasure in their sor^ rows, considered as disunited from the purposes, intended to be served by them ^ We likewise discern that, he doth not suffer any of the saints, to fall under depression of spirit, with a view to discourage any unregenerate sinner, from coming to Christ, or from entering u(X)n a holy life: for, saitb-an apostle, " God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man "."—But, he permit-teth them, I humbly apprehend, so to lose their spiritual comfort, as to be disquieted and distressed in spirit, especially for the following purposes:

K That he may thereby, render them the more conformable- to his beloved Son, their head and representative in . the new covenant. So delighted is Jehovah the Father, with the image of his infinitely dear Son, who, as the second. Adam, is the* first bom among many brethren f that he hath resolved, that the objects of his redeeming lovie, shaU,-as much as possible, consistently with their eter-tisX salvation, be conformed to that imi^e, not only in point of holiness, but of stiffeting. •* Whom he did foreknow," says the apostle Paul, " he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of )ii» Son, that he might be the first-bom among many brethren "^^ Now, seeing that the Lord Jipsue, in his estate of humiliation ki this world, suffered, not only in his body, but in his soul^ God the Father, hath determined, that the spiritual seed fif Christ ^U in tM& worlds resemble bim, by uuS"

fering more or less in their souls, as well as in their bodies. As Christ endured in his soul, an awful suspension of Divine consolation, together with a dreadful impression of vindictive wrath ; so believers, in order to resemble .him, do sometimes endure the hiding of their heavenly Father's countenance, and the sense of paternal anger, wliiclv they often mistake for vindictive wrath. • Hereby they drink of his cup: they are partakers of his sufierings; and so are able from experience to say, ** Ashe was, so are we in this world^." For^ though they never actually experience, in their trouble of soul, that vindictive wrath, which Christ Jesus felt in his; yet, by this conformity to him, they have fellowship with him in bis sufferings, and attain some small experience of the bitterness of what he endured for them; and sotheylearn, the more highly to esteem him, the more ardently to love him, and the more gratefully to remember his immense love to them.

2. He suffers them to lose for a season, their comfort, that he may make themfiel more sensibly^ and see more clearly^ the deep depravity of their nature. We read that, Jehovah led the Israelites ♦* through a great and terrible wilderness, wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, and where no water was ; that he might humble them, and prove them, to do them good at their latter end," by discovering to them, what was in their hearts ^, In like manner, he sometimes withholds his influences of comfort, from believers, and leavelh them for a season, under depressioo

of spirit J in order that he may prove them, and give them, more clear and humbling discoveries of the depth and strength of the corruption, which

. remaineth in them *. The hearts of believers,-^ are like the waters of the sea, which in a calm appear to be clear ; but no sooner does a storm arise and agitate them, than they begin *^ to cast up mipe and dirt" When Christians are at ease, they sometimes think, that their corruptions are not^ strong, and ihat their graces are not sq weak, as they really are: they flatter tliemselves, that thoir sanctiiication is much further advanced, than it actually is. But* when their comfort is gone, and their hearts are troubled; what unbelief^ what pride, what deadness^ what enmity against a holy God, what impatience, what nmrmuring, what strange unbecoming thoughts of God, arise and appear in their hearts; which they never before, could eitlier feel .or believe to be there! Mental trouble serves, in the hand of the Holy Spirit, to shew them, how deeply rooted, how inveterate, how malignant, their depravity is; and what reason they have to be greatly ashamed, and to blush, before the omniscientaud holy Lord God. It was, upon Job's having been grievously afflicted in spirit, that he discerned more vileness in his heart, than he could formerly, have suspected to be in it ^ ; and that he learned, deeply to abhor himself as a sinner^. There are abominations which}

, like nests of vipers, lie so quietly within f .that believers do not suspect them to be there, till the xod

Some corraptknis lie so rerj deep in their hearts^ that they can hardly discern them. But as fire under a pot, cauaea the scum to rise up and run over ; so trouble o£ mind brings up from, the bottom of the heart, such deep corruptions to- view, as the most enlightened of the saints, could otherwise, scarcely have conceived to be there: and discoveries esspedaUy of tkese^ are necessary to dap humiliation of ^irit, before the Lord..

3. Another design which God. hath, in inflicting trouble of spirit upon some of his children, is, that he may thereby chasten them for their sins, and so, imlniter sin to them. Disquietude of soul k to believers, a fatherly chastisement. The Lord resoheth thereby to correct them. He determioes that, by their bitterness of soul, they shall *^ know and see, that it is-an. evil thing and biitet^ that thejr have forsaken- Etim^." By this most- afflictive dispensation, he thus speaketh to each of them; •* Thy ways and thy doings have procured these things unto thee : this is thy wickedness, because it is bittei^ because it reachetkuoto thine heart ^.^ As the Lord never chasteneth any of his children^ but for their profit '; so he never afflicteth them with spiritual trouble, except when it is necessary for that purpose. Accordingly the aposUe Peter saith, " Ye are now for a season, (if need be,), in heaviness, through manifold temptations'." By suspending his influences of consolation, from their souls, and so imbittering their sins to them, the Lord weakeneth the remains of corruption in them..

He thereby, renders them more wise, and circumspect, and so he preventeth much sin, into which, they otherwise would fall ^. By this painful dis^ cipline, their souls are ^^ purified, and made white, and tried;" and so by sad experience, they are made to feel, as well as to see, that their sin is ejk^ ceeding sinfuL By withholding for a season, consolation from them, he shews them, the evil of their not having improved their former comfort well; of their having made for themselves, a saviour of their pleasant frames, by relying on them^ rather than on Jesus Christ. By permitting dis* trust and despondency to prevail against thaOf and so to occasion much trouble and perplexity of mind to them ; he teaches them, the exceeding sin* fulness of their unbelief and distrust. His desigit in hiding his face from them, is, to teach them that they did wrong in setting a small value upon his favour, and the light of his countenance. If ha layeth them under a painful sense of his anger, it is, to make them sensible of their folly, as well as ingratitude, in provoking his displeasure* By piercing their hearts with deep sorrow, he teaches them, the sinfulness of their having pierced his be^ loved Son, and grieved his Holy Spirit. If he maketh them experience the tenor of his vindictive wrath, or the dread of suffering, through eternity, the pains of hell: it is to teach them, the extreme folly of their not having been afraid of sinning against him. One part of his design, ia. sufiering his fieiy law, to re-enter and distress their ' consciences, is, to make them deeply sensible of

tfae great evil of their legal spirit. By permitting them for a time, to lose siglit of their evidences of grace; he teaches them, that they ought never to be proud of their attainments in religion, nor to trust in grace received. If he appears not to stand in the relation of a Father, to tliem, it is to render them more sensible, that they have not acted the part of obedient children, to him. By seeming to shut out their prayers, he reproves them, for restraining prayer, and for their unbelieving, wandering, and vain thoughts in prayer. When he permits them to be afraid, that they are yet under the dominion of spiritual death; it is to teach them, tlie great evil of deadness and coldness of heart, in th^ir acts of worship. If he denies them, his re-Tiring and consoling presence, in reading and hearing his blessed word; it is to make them deeply sensible of the sinfulness, of their having despised his glorious gospeL And if he leaveth any of thern^ to fell into some gross and open sin ; his design may be to chasten them, for having suffered themselves to commit secret iniquity. By thus chastening them, the Lord instmcteth them in the exceeding sinfulness of their sin **; in order that, they may so bewail and abhor it, as to turn with fuller determination of heart from it, to Him as their gra« cious God and Fatlier. Hereby he also teaches them-, that if he leave them but for a single moment, they will instantly fall, even into the most atrocious crimes. Ah 1 how deep, how inveterate,

is their disease, when a potion so bitter, is requisitt to accomplish their cure }

4. The Lord withholds consolation from some of his people, and suffers them for a season, (o walk in darkness, in order to try and exercise thm graces. Hereby the graces of the Spirit in them, are tried or proved, and their truth, as weU as tbm weakness or strength, is manifested to them. ** Now for a season,^' says the apostle PetePj " ye are in heaviness, through manilbld temptations | that the trial of your fiiith, being much more pre* cious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and benoor and glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ '•>'' ISo affliction is so grievous and so trying, as spiritosi distress. The Lord therefore inflicteth spiritual trouble, sometimes, upon believers, in order that be may try their faith and other graces, and so disoovei these to them. It appears to have been one ci the designs of Job's spiritual trouble, to try, and so to manifest to himself and others, the sUtmg faith, and the invincible patience, which God had given him. There are some graces in the heart of a holy man, which are discovered more clearly to him, by means of spiritual trouble,, than of any external affliction. When he finds tlial he has beeu enabled, to trust in the Loi^d Jesus, at the very time in which, he was frowning upon him, and seeming even to slay him; to love hkn for Himself, when he had no reviving, sense of his love to him 5 and to follow him with longings and prayers, in the midst of darkness and discouragement;

*TO LOSE THEIR SPIRITUAL COMFORT. 213

his is afterwards a dear proof to him, of the realty of these graces in his soul. Trouble of mind, luring its continuance, renders the exercise of praces, and the performance of duties, peculiarly lifficult. If believers, then, when they are under piritual distress, continue still to cleave in some legree, to God in Christ, and so to love him, as to irefer Him before every other object of afiection, nren when he seemeth to be casting off their souls, ind to be shutting out their prayers; this, when ^ey afterwards rdHect upon it, will be an evidence to them, that they are sincere, and that their love to him is supreme. Moreover, when they are enabled, under that most grievous trial, to exerciee in some degreCj their graces; tliose graces, are not •only roanifestedto their consciences, but are strengthened Bnd increased, by their exercise of them. The same affliction that serves, in the hand of the Holy Spirit, to try and discover their graces, serves also to excite them to exercise; and the more they are exercised, the more the habit of them is strengthened. When the Lord thus chasteneth any of his ^ear children, it is invariably for their profit, that Ahey may be partakers of his holiness. For this •« cliastening, though for the pi-esent, it is not joyous, but grievous," exceedingly grievous; « never-theless, afterwards it yiekleth the peaceable fruit of righteousness, to them who are exercised there-by ^r It supplies them, in the mean time, wrth special occasions, for striving and wrestling agam^ Iheir spiritual enemies, for swiming against the ^eam, for pressing on as through an opposing

crowd; and thus, their graces have special oppor^ tunities afforded them, of becoming stronger by frequent exercise. It affords occasion, for many actings of faith and love, of repentance and resignation; and for many ardent longings, and heavei^ ly breathing^, which otherwise wouki not, perhaps^ be experienced. Besides, the exercise of the graces of his Holy Spirit in believers, especially of that grace in which, eacfh of them excels, is so pleasing to the Lord; that he will on no account, sufler them to want occasion, nay, frequent occasion, for such exercise'.

5. His design also in withholding consolation, is, to teach them by experience, their continual need of living upon Christ by faith; and so, to raider Him the more precious to them. " I will leave iu the midst of thee," saith Jehovah, " an afflicted aid poor people; and they shall trust in the name of the Lord"*." Paul and Timothy, «*-had the sentence of death in themselves, that they should not trust in themselves, but in God who raiscth the dead '*•" It is not enough, that the saints merely believe their need, every moment, of fresh supplies of grace from the fulness of Christ: they must be made to see and to feel that need. Nor is it suflS-cient for them, merely to believe that it is tlieir duty, at all times, to trust in him for those supplies: they must be made to see clearly^ and to feel deeply, their extreme need to do so. They must, by experience, be made deeply sensible tliat, without afresh supply of grace at the time, the}'

' Ps. cxlvii 11. Soug ii. 14. and iv. 9. « Zeph. iii. 12. " 2 Cor. i. 9.

«re as uoable to perform spiritually ^ single duty, ■as they were, even in their unregenerate state ^. So very unwilling are they, to believe this, and to regulate their spiritual exercise according to it| 4hat for ordinary, they must be trained up to it by sad experience. Now the Lord suspendeth in^ fioeoces of comfort, from many of them, and for 41 season, inflicteth upon them, a greater or Jess degree of mental trouble; in order to make them se6 and feel, how much need they have at all times, to trust in Christ, for continued supplies from his fulness $ and to render them deeply sensible, that they cannot otherwise, perform even die least degree of acceptable obedience, than by trusting solely and firmly in Him, f9r new communications of sanctify-iog grace, to enable them to perform it. To trust daily^ and with unsuspecting confidence, in the great Trustee of the new covenant, tliat he will, •by his Holy Spirit, " work in them, both to will and to (//?," is of such necessity and importance to their growing in grace; that, rather than leave them ignorant thereof, God will teach his children, even by discipline, the most painful, how needful it is to do so. He will permit them to feel, what anguish of soul, their neglecting the daily exercise of fiuth in the Lord Jesus, wiU occasion to them ; in order that, he may reduce them to the happy necessity of placing, at all times, the confidence of their hearts in Him only; and that, for comforting, as well as for sanctifying influences. He will imbitter a life of sense to them, that he may dispose them to relish a life of faith. He will make

216 DESIGNS OF god's PERMrTTIKG BiSLfEVjCaS

them know by experience, what their haying trusted in their habits of grace, hath procured fiir them; that they may discern the exceeding nnibl-ness of a legal spirit, and see that, without fiutli, t>r the daily exercise of direct confidence in the is-camate Redeemer, it will be impossible for them to please him P. The death of their sensible comfort, will shew them the necessity of a life of fiuth. The Lord giveth to many of his saints^ frightM discoveries of sin and wrath, in tyr^r that, by being «liaken, they may learn to rely the firmer <cn the sure foundation, which he hath laid in Zion^. He hideth liimself from them, and delayeth to help them, till they be in extremity; that, they my learn tiie higli and difficult 4irt of living by Cudi, and not by sight. Living by signs of grace, is most natural and pleasing to them; but living by faith, is most acceptable to Him. The sight of their evidences of grace, indeed, cannot &il to be delightful to them; biit the sight of Jesus, by faith, ought to be a thousand times more delight-fuL But when they pore so much and so lon^ upon their evidences, as to be thereby, prevented from direct and frequent actings of trust in the Saviour, they so far dishonour and displease him. When they build their comfort and hope, upon their evidences, instead of building all their comfort, and all their liope, upon Him; they at once, greatly dishonour him, and deeply injure themselves. Thus they render it necessary, that he hide his face, doud their evidences, and wither their comforts^ in order that they may learn, to prefer

P Heb. xi. 6. 9 Isa^ xxviii. 16.

befi»« their clearest evidences, and tbeir liveliest frames; to set a higher value upon the husband of their souls Himsdf, than upon the braoetets and jewels, whidi they receive (ram him>; and that they may study the art, in the absence of evidences and frames, of living above them, upon himsdf, who is their life and consdation, their h<^ and all in all. In this manner, he wisely and graciously trains them up, to trust as sinners in himself; to r^ on him, not as felt by them, but as offered to them; to depend on him onfy; and to stay upon him as theirs in the gospel-ofier, whm fedings and comforts fell them ^ As nothing done by believers, glorifies the great Redeemer so much, as their acting of particular trust in him, for salvation ; so,, if necessary, he wi41 rather hide every other object of confidence from their view, ihan suffer them to continue resting on it, instead of trusting in Him *• In few words, his grand design is, to render Himself, and his redeeming grace, more precious to them; to shew them experimen-tally^ that none can calm -the tumults of a troubled soul, but himself cnly ^; and, that without Him, they can do nothing that is spiritually good "•

6. Another end, which the Lord proposethto himself, in afflicting believers with trouble of mind, is, that they may be stirred up to search the Scrips tureSf mare earnestlj/, and more frequently: it is, to moke them capable of relishing, and of esteeming his glorious gospel, tlie more. One great design of the doctrines and. promises of sacred Scripture, is,

to comibrt the saints under their manifold a£9ic-tions. Accoi*dingIy» the most part of the precioaB promises, is adapted and made to them, considered* as in circumstances of trouble: for, although they assent to the truth of them $ yet they cannot, so ivdl and so feelingly, experience the suitableness and sweetness of them, unless they are, aometinies, brought into the circumstances to which they re-&r. The Lord saith, <^ Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will ddiver thee ^;" " I will be with him in trouble; I wiUdeliverhim, and honour him V ^* I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him, and to his mouiiiers ^. Now, till the day of trouble come, believers do not know by experience, either the use or the value^ of such promises as these; because they are not in the condition, to which they relate. Were they to continue long without affliction, and especially, without some degree of spiritual trouble, they would, at least many of tliem would, be but slightly affected with the doctrines and promises of the gospd ^ because they could not feel their need of that consolation, which many of these are designed to afford. If they had no burthens to weigh them down, no fears to disquiet them, no distress of conscience to exercise them; much of the good word of God, would comparative] v be of little use to them. Without such trou-ble in a jcrreater or less degree, the saints could not have an opportunity of experiencing the truth, suitableness, and sweetness, of many of the promises: tliey could not feel the need, nor understand tlic true meaning, of a great part of the

Bible. Indeed, were believers always tiiumphingy in the unmingled light of God*s countenance; they should diereby^ as one expresses it, ' be cut off irom half of the promises of the gospeL' In order, then, that they may fed their need of -all the de-claratiousy and promises of the blessed gospel; and SO, be trained up to set such an high value upon the Scriptoees, as to search them carefully, and diligently; the Lord permits them, sometimes, tp fall under distress of mind. At those times, a sense of need urges them to look eagerly, and fire-quently, into his blessed word; in order to see if there are any doctrines, or directions, or promises, in it, suited to revive their drooping spirits, or to <x>nsole their disquieted souls. And when they find, as tbey sooner or later shall do, any passages of it, which through grace afford direction, or consolation, to their troubled souls; each of them will ,from experienced be able, with the holy Psalmist, to say, *^ This is my comfort in my affliction $ for thy word hath quickened me ^." " Thy testimonies also are my delight, and my counsellors K*^ ** It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes ^.'*

7. God inflicteth trouble of spirit, upon many of his children, to the end that, by supporting them under it, and delivering them from it, he may the more effectually recomniend to them^ the infinite suit' ablenesSf riches^ and freene&Sy of his redeeming grace. It is impossible for a man, who has never experienced in any degree, the distress of a wounded conscience, highly to esteem and admire the

,220 DESIGNS OF god's PERMITTING BELIEVERS

grace of the Lord Jesus Christ It is only, • when his conscience hath been distressed by a galling sense of guilt, and his soul been troubled with a fear of deserved wrath, as well as renewed by the Holy Spirit ; that he can eagerly desire, and cor-. dially embrace, the promises of redeeming mercy, or see the inestimable value of super^abounding grace. One of the designs of God, therefi)re^ in laying any of his people in the depths of spiritual trouble, is, that they may in their deliverance, see what reason they have, highly to prize, and gratefully to adore, the transcendent riches and freeness of his glorious grace; that when they are delivered from ** the sorrows of death, whidi compassed them, and from the pdns of hell, which got hdltd upon them;" each df them may from experience, be able to say, \^ith the Psalmist, " Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful. The Lord preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me. Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee. For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling *." When, in their deliverance, believers are made to see that, from.the thickest darkness, the Lord hath l^rought them forth to the light; that, be hath overruled the greatest evils in their hearts, for good to them; that, when they were bleeding inwardly, and when no man, nor angel, could afford them relief, he kept them from bleeding to death; that, after they had been hearing the tremendous thun-,ders of his fiery law, he hath caused them to hear

for themselves, the rieviving sound of his gospel y' that, after they had been at the very mouth of hell, and bad, as it were, been smelling the fire and brimstone, he hath exalted them to the hope of heaven; that, notwithstanding their distrustful and hard thoughts of him, he hath been gracious to them; that, after they had been very undutiiul to him, he hath been kind and compassionate to them; that5 after they had, by their desponding fears, reflected much dishonour upon him, he hath caused their souls to hppe in his mercy; and that, after they, had been sinking in the waters of trouble, he bath set-their feet upon a rock, and filled.them with joy and peace in believing: when, I say, they are made to experience so great a deliverance, they cannot fail to be deeply affected with the. sovereign-ty, the riches, and the fr^eness of redeeming grace. One design of God, then, in the infliction of men-^ tal distress, upon any of his-saints, and afterwards * in delivering them from it is, to afford them sp^ cial opportunities of esteeming, admiring, and adoring, his immense love, and boundless grace to ' them. Hereby, his glorious method of salvation by Jesus Christ, is exceedingly endeared to their ^ souls.

&. Another end which the Lord hath, in permitting some of the saints so to lose their spiritual comfort, as to be disquieted in spirit, is, that thereby, be may rouse them to greater diligence in watch" ing and prat/iiig.

Disquietment of jsoul serves, in the hand'of the Holy Spirit, to stir them up to greater watchful^ ness. A man who walk« in the dark, fipds it ne» ccMsai^ to be the more careful, wViete, WidiVorw^Xife

treads. To be lifted up, and cast dewn; to b* emptied, as it were, from vessel to vessel^ is of great utility to excite believers to be always watchful.

By these means, the Lord also rouseth them io-prenf more earnestly, and more frequently. Accordingly, Heman, when he was in his deep distress of soul, was much employed in prayer. ** G Lord God of my salvation, saith he, I have cried day and night before thee**." So was David: ** Thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled: 1 cried to thee, C) Lord; and unto the Lord I made supplication*," " I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble,, when my spirit was overwhelmed within me'.** And Hezd(iah likewise: " O- Lord, I am oppressed : undertake for me ^." And Jonah: •* When-my soul fainted within me, I remembered the Lord 5 and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine lioly Temple ^." It was not, until Peter was beginning to sink in the sea, that he cried, " Lord •save me ^" There are, I believe, more prayers iit the writings of David and of JPeremiah, than iu any other parts of tlie sacred Volume. Indeed, manyof the saints, would not be so frequently on their knees, as they are, if trouble of spirit did Hot weigh them down. This, then, is one of the Lord's designs in going away, that believers may pursue after him. And he will never so hide himself from them, as to reader it impossible for them to find him ; nor will he depart any faster or farther, than he will enable them so to follow, as to^

Many of the saints, are afflicted with trouble of mind, to the end that they may thereby, be tie more jpreparedjor spiritual comfort^ and that their consolation, in time to come, may be tht greaia\ Sometimes, the Lord inflictcth ^iritual distress vpon many of his children, in order that, he may ^ afterwards give them the more comfort, and that, dieir comfort may be the more pure, sweet, aud solid. He inflicteth it, in onier to prepare them for that strong consolation, which he hath dei«ign-ed for them; to make them relish and value it. the more, and be the more solicitous to possess and retain it. When the church, after Christ had withdrawn himself and departed, found him again, ** she bekl him, and would not let him go '•" As a tree, by being shaken with the stormy wind, is the more deeply and strongly rooteil in the ground ; so believers are, sometimes, " tossed as with temjTest, and not comforted»," that they may ^v faith, cleave the more closely to Christ, and thereby de^ rive the more strength and consolation from his fulness: for the more, they •* continue in the laith. grounded and settled," the greater, wiU their peace

and th«r comfort be ^. Moreover, when the Lord*, by the witnessing of his Spirit, assures them thai they have been enabled to love him, even when he seemed to be haling tliem^ and with lamentation and desire, to follow after him, when he appeared to be going away from them; such a dear evidence of the truth-of grace in'tbemf as thi^, cannot fail to yield a pleasing satisfaction to their souls. It is the manner of the Lord Jesus, to empty the souls of his children, that he may fill them ; to cast them down, that he may lift them up; to trouble them, that he may the more effectually comfbri them; and to take away from them, a smaUer degree of mental serenity, that he may prepare room in their souls, for a greater measure of pure oonso* lation^. He commonly suffers the bitter waters of trouble, to swell; in order that the sweet wji* ters of holy consolation, may afterwards rise higher than ever, in their souls. Inward trouble is, in bis hand^ a mean of enlarging the capacity of the holy soul; and the more capable that soul is, of cotnfoit, the more consolation iis poured into it« Heaviness of spirit also humbleth such a soul^ and true humility is, as it were, the vessel inta which, the wine of consolation is poured. A humble spirit is a deep spirit, and the deeper the spirit is> it is fitted to contain the more consolation. Besides, as food is doubly sweet after hunger, and light, after darkness; so is consolation, after anguish of spirit. By their want of i^iritual comfort for a season, the Lord teacheth his people, to know more of the value of it; and when they leara

to prize it, and to tru&t coDstantly and solely ia the great Redeemer for it, ,as a part of their salva-* tioD, tlie more of it shall they receive.

JO. Another design of God, in laying some *ofliis children, in the depths of spiritual trouble, is, to render them the more compasi^ionaie toward other saints around them, M'hen they sec them depressed in spirit. As no outwanl. afBiction, ?how painful soever it may be, is so dreadful and overwhelming, • as anguish of spirit is; so, if it is the duty of a ^ Christian, to shew compassion to such fellow*Christians as are under the former; Duich more ought '-one, to shew pity to such of them as are under the latter. ^ Surely, the most tender compassion from feUow^saints, is due to those who have ^^the arrows of-the Almighty within them, the poison of wliich, is drinking up their spirits.-' Such perplexing dis- * tress, calls aloud-for the greatest sympathy, the tenderest pity ;* as that of Job did, from his friends. *' Have pity upon me, said he, have pity upon.me^ > O-ye my friends; £[>r the hand of God hath touch- ' ed me K** Those Christians are deq)]y wounded in .their spirits.; and such wounds, require to be touched with a tender, as.-welLas-with a skilful « hand. . But none of their fiellow-Christians, are so -well qualified, to treat them with gentleness and tenderness,, or^ speak to them with mildness and pity,^ as they who .were themselves, in' the same -dolefiil condition, and have been mercifully delivev-ed firom it. The Lord then, permitteth some of his saints so to lose their comfort, as.to become disquieted in spirit; in order to render them the *

more compassionate, toward others c^ their breth* ren who are in spiritual trouble; and also, the more capable, as weH as desirous, of being mstru'-meutal in binding up their wounds, witk a lender heart, and with a gentle hand. In that way, he teacheth them most effectually, to '^ put on boweI» of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, and meekness,^ toward such as are in any trouble, es*-pecially in mental trouble f and so, he qualifier them to be merciful and helpful to such.

Moreover, in inflicting upon some of the saints, a painful sense of his anger, the Lord may aiso have it in view, to teach them so to pity unregauf' ■ate sinners around them, as willingly to seise ewrj £lk opportunity, of instructing them in the way of salvation ^; and of kbourihg, from their own experience of the terror of the Lord, to persuade them to flee speedily from sin, and from the tremendoiu .wrath due for sin, to the compassionate Saviour for salvation. Those of the saints who have been in trouble of mind j can, from the anguish and terror, which they tJiemselves have experienced^ feet A compassionate and a deep concern fer the dread* ful condition of secure sinners; and can say more than others can, to assure them, that ^* it is a fear-ful thing to faM into the hands of the livings God V

neither are readiness and skill, in comforting them who are cast down. They, who have been led through the depths of dejection and temptation^ are better acquainted, than other Christians are, with the Tarions griefs, fears, perplexities, and oon« Hicts, of the heart in those depths; and therefiNre they know better, ** how to speak a word in season to them who are weary." They have had experience of great and sore trouble, of being supported under it, and afterwards, of being comforted with deliverance from it. The Lord therefore casteth some, yea many, of the saints down, and in a little, raiseth them up again $ that they may learn from experience, not only to pity, but, with medmess of wisdom, to comfort others of them^ who are cast down. The apostle Paul, accordingly, «* was troubled on e\'ery side,*' cast down, and then comforted j in order that, be might attaia eminent skill in comforting otlier saints. *< Bless* ed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesua Christ,'^ says he, *^ who comforteth us in ail oar tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort, wherewith we ourselves are comforted of Ood. Whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and sal-Tation;«».or whether we be comforted, it is for your cMisofation and salvation *." The Lord hath work for some of his children to do, which nonei^ them can perform so weU, as they who are thus quali» fied for it He hath sin sick souls to be visited and -healed, tempted souk to be relieved, drooping spirits 4a be revivedi weak hands to be strengtheimli and

feeble knees to be confirmed^ It was necessary that, the apostle Peter should have sad experience oF his own weakness, in order that, he might be qualified for strengthening his brethren ^ Besides, as s man under a dangerous mala^, will choose rather, to intrust himself to the eare of that Fhy« ftician, who, by having been afflicted with the same distemper, hath much experience of it, than to that of another who never was afflicted with it; so troubled souls will be more attentive to, and more affected by, the advices and ^leouragements, suggested by that Christian, who speaks to them from his own experience, than by those of any other Christian.

12. It is likewise the intention of God, by that most painful discipline, to prepare some of his child-xetif for* special and eminent service to Him. Some believers continue aU their days in a low way, and have neither much trouble^ nor much comfort; they experience little distressing fear, and as little joyful hope. Thei^ are believers, of a lower class^ -Others again, are raised up aloft, in flashes, and even in raptures, of sensible joy; but they do not perceive distinctly, the objects which are below: various mistakes, and failings, and improprieties^ in their mind and conduct, do alsnest- entirely escape their notice. These too are Christians of an inferior rank. But, when the Lord is training up any of his redeemed, for special and eminent service to him, he commonly brinjgs diem low, and employs them in deep exercises, and sharp-conflicts with motions of sin within^ and temptatioDs

of Satan, from without He bringeth them into depths of ^iritaal trouble, and giveth them deep, humbling, and c^en irightfal, discoTeries of the strength and sinfulness of the unbelief, and other abominations, which lie deep in their hearts. He bideth his face from them, and permits their spiritual enemies, frequently to assault them, and sometimes to prevail so against them, as to threaten their eternal destruction. At the same time, he secretly upholds them; and when the design of the disprnmtinn is gained, he comforts them with de-liverancei Thus he advances them to higher de« grees of experimental knowledge, to more enlarged views of themselves and of Christ, of sin and of hdiness, and of the suitableness, riches, and free-ness of redeeming grace, than other believers attain. He thereby renders them more intelligent, wise, and humble, more deeply sensible of their infinite obligations to-him, more disposed to trust firmly, and at all times, in the Lord Jesus, and more zealous, lively, and active for his glory, than the generality of other believers; and so, lie prepares them for special service,-and eminent usefulness in their generation. Some think, and indeed it is probable, that Heman was laid in the dark* ness and the depths, expressed in the IxxxviiL Psalm, in order that, he might be qualified for that eminent station in tlie Church, to which he was raised. Doubtless, it is in proportion as believers attain deep experience, that they have the capacity, and especially the wisdom, requisite for superior usefulness in the Church of Christ.

13. Another purpose which the Lord hath to serve, by the spiritual trouble oV mwBj ^\ifl.\^^ij^v

230 DESIGNS or GOD*S PERMITTING BEIIE:VERS

pie, is, to encourage and confirm their hope ; and so to render them the more lively, in their exercise of graces, and performance of duties. ** We glory in tribulations ako," says Paul, ** knowing that tribulation worketh patience; and patience, expe* rience; and experience, ^?p^"." And Jeremiah: ** This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope ''•'* God suffereth some of his dear children, to lose for a season, their tranquillity of mind; in order that, he may take occasion from their perplexity, to favour them with such expckfience of bis grace and mercy, power and faithfulness, in supporting them under it, in freeing them from it, and in sanctifying it to them ; as also, with such experience of the truth of their faith, and the uprightness of their heart under it, as will encourage, and confirm their hope of eternal life. Although it is not the experience of a hot|r man, but the righteousness of Christ, and the promises of God, offered to him in the gospel, that are the Jmmdatiom of his hope of salvation ; yet, his past and present ex})erience encourages him to hope; -Such experience, as is a proof to him of his pergonal interest in Jesus and his great salvation, -worketh hope; in as much as, it aflbrds him great encouragement, both to expect and to desire complete salvation. His experience also, of deadness of frame and coldness of love, of dejection of mind 'ond sadness of heart, of powerful support under these, and of comfortable deliverance from them ; flerves exceedingly, through the power of the Holy Spirit) to make him abound in hoper and the mm^

he abounds in the delightful exercise of that liV'* ing hope, which is founded upon the living Redeemer, and which hatb tor its object, the et^nal ^oyment of the living God, the more lively and cheetful, wOI he be, in all spiritual exercise, and holy obedience. When he reflects that his great Redeemer hath, in his love, and in his pity, deli* vered him from the greatest of all troubles, and restored to him the joy of his salvation; be is encouraged, yea, and sweetly constrained, to expect from such a Saviour, the greatest blessedness, the highest fdicity, of which his nature will, through all eternity, be capable.

14. One end which the Lord may have to ac-^ eomplish, by inflicting spiritual trouble upon some, js, the instructioti of others of his children. He jseemeth, in his adorable sovereignty and infinite wisdom, to have resolved, that some of his redeemed should be afflicted with inward, as well as with outward troubles, for the instrilctipn of the rat. By subjecting some, to that most painfol discipline, he appears to have determined that others of them, shall thereby learn, the exceeding sinlulnes^ of their own unbelief and other sins; the necessity of trusting simply^ cordially, and at all tones, in the Lord Jesus, ibr sanctifying grace $ the unqpeakp •able importance of holy comfort, and of constant jelianee upon Christ, for the countinuance, and iur-^crease of it; and the duty of being more thankfiil . to him, for the peace of conscienoe which they en-joy, as' well as of being more circumspect, and •more solicitous not to provoke his .displeasure. Spiritual trouble seems peculiarly adapted, as an

15. Ano^er design which God may have, in aC> fiicting many of the saints for a season, witk4rou« ble and terror of conscience, is, ta assure: wicked men around them, of a judgment^ and of tmnth to ceme. His intention thereby seems to be, to. giv« assurance to unregenerate sinners, and ibat, by their very senses, .that there sliall be a future judgment, in which it shall be ill. with the wick* €d, • *^ seeing^ the -reward of his hands, shall - be given him ^ ;" that, " if the righteous shall be re* compensed in the earth; much more the wicked and the sinner y;" and that, *Mf judgment begins at the house of< God,? inexpressibly dreadful^ *< shall the end be, of tliem that obey not the gospel of God ^." The saints, are the objects of Jei* -hovab's. immense, and unchangeable love: they ape unspeakably precious in his sight, and are kept .by himf as the apple .of his eye. They.love him aik premely, and study sincerely to please and iionoor him. Jesus Christ their Divine surety, hath fully satisfied hi& justice, for all their offences: and yet» he afflicteth many of them in tliis worlds widi a grievous, and perplexing sense of bis anger against ihem fbr>their sins, and even, with an overwhelming dread of bis eternal wrath. Now, may it not be partly the intentioiir of God, by-thus afiUcting many of his own dear children, to shew ta uscooc-

Hereby, be afibrds them evident warning of their danger, before it is too late, and gives them repeated opportunities of making, each of thero^ this reflection : * If even Go<i's own children, experience such terror and anguish of soul, when they are only under the mild rod of his fatherly anger, and that, for their salvation i how inconceivably more horrible, and intolerable, will the torment of his enemies, and of me in particular, if I continue but a h'ttle longer, an enemy to him, be, when we shall lie, through eternal ages, under the unrelent** ing strokes of his vindictive wrath, for our destruc'^

16. Lastly, The Lord inflicteth trouble of spirit^ upon many of the saints, on purpose to manifest ki$ own glojy^ To display the glory of God in Christ, is, indeed, the chief and ultimate end of that dispensation, to. which, every other end is subordinate* His chief design in inflicting spiritual trouf-ble, is, the manifestation of the infinitely glorioua perfections of his nature. Next to that unparalleled display of the glory of his attributes, which hath been made in the sufierings of Christ, their Covenant'head; is, perhaps, the display of it, which is afibrded in the suflerings, especially in the mental suflerings, of the members of his mystical body. The glory of his manifold wisdom, shineth illustriously, in devising those circumstances of their mental trouble, which are, of all others, the fittest for subserving the deibigns of his grace in their sanctification ; the glory also of his infinite power, both in supporting them under \.ba\. ^^^V

est of a]l afflictions, and then, in delivering them from it; the glory of his holiness, in hiding bis face from them, and in laying them, on account of their sins, under dreadful impressions of his anger, even though they still continue to be the objects of bis redeeming love; the glory of his justice, in raising them to the full enjoyment of the salvation purchased for them, even by discipline, the moel painful, rather than suifering them to come short of it; the glory of his love, grace, and mercy, in (Us-pensing, whenever it is needful, temporary'trouble, in order to prevent that eternal torment which tbey deserve, in mitigating that trouble, and in deliveiw ing them from it, as soon as the ends of inflicting it are served; the glory of his faithfulness, in performing the* promise of that kind of patemat chastisement, which is the most grievous, rather than leave a single promise, unperformed to than; and, the glory of his sovereignty, in thus afflicting, for their good, whomsoever, whensoever, and in what degree soever, he pleaseth. He displays the -glory of his infinite sovereignty, by dispensing to his people, trouble and comfort, sorrow and gladness, just as it pleases him. Upon that ground, Eiihu vindicated the Lord's afflicting of Job, without questioning, as Job's other three friends bad done, his integrity. " I will answer thee," says he, " that God is greater than man. Why do6t thou strive against him ? for he giveth not account of any of his matters^." By infflcting marital trouble on some of his saints, the Most High dieweth tliem, and others around them, what.be

tould do with them, if he would. By so doing, he mttketh it manifest that it is He, ** who formeth the light, and createth darkness; who maketh poace, and createth evil^" He thereby makes them deeply sensible, that all their comforts, whether ontward or inward, depend as entirely on His sovereign pleasure, as their election and regencra-.tion did.

From what has here been said, disconsolate Jbielievers may see that, the Lord never withholds •ensible comfort from them, but when.his doing so, isjbr their gpod^ in subservience to kis txcti gfonf. Although the loss of spiritual consolation, and the trouble of mind which ensues, are in Ihenisehts, diseouragements from holy practice, and even ob» ttnictions to it;. yet, the Lord hath appointed that many of the saints, shall sometimes be afflicted with these, in order that they may in his hand, subserve the designs of his grace^ in theii* sanctifi* cation and salvation. . Were believers always alike: were they continually in a lively fraiiie: could tliey invariably exercise ardent love, and sensible joy; they would begin to think that, the |lower to do so, was inherent, and that it was in a great measure, their own. But when, by means of their want of consolation, they are made deeply sensible that, of themselves they can do nothings and that, they need to depend continually on Christ, for supplies from his fulness; they are hereby prepared to glorify him, both by trusting in him, and by advancing in conformity to hinu

From the foregoing particulars, exercised Chris* tiaiis may also see that, when outward and inward troubles, at any time, meetT upon them, thi^ is bo proof, ^iiAer that they are unregenerate^ or that Gad U their enemy. Believer, when thou art under great and sore troubles, Satan will try to persuade thee, that they are proofs of thy hypocrisy ; and that if God loved thee, he would never subject thee to such long, complicated, and grievous calamities. The construction, which Job's three friends put upon his complicated, and grievous afflictions, was^ that they evidenced him to be a hypocrite, and God to be his enemy. When waters of a full cup, art measured out to thee, do not conclude that God doth

Heman suffered t^rors, which threatened to overwhelm his amazed soul, and that, not for a short season, but from his youth up ; and yet, instead of concluding that God was his enemy, or that He did not love him, he addressed God, as the *^ Lord God of his salvation *."

Believers may hence see that, ihe^ ha'oe no reason to be offended at the ways of godliness, on account of any trouble, how grievous soever it may be, which they sometimes endure in those ways. They have no sufficient reason to ** be weary, or faint in their minds." Their gracious God and Father, proposeth to himself the best of all ends, in afflicting them; namdy, their sanctification, in subordination to his own gl(Hy: and they may rest •assured, that they shall at no time, be afflicted -with any degree, either of inward, or of outward "trouble, but what infinite wisdom sees necessaiy^ for attaining those ends. The kind, <legree, and -continuance of their-troubles, are all fixed, by the immutable decree of their heavenly Father, who lovetfa them ; whose wisdom could not have devis--ed less, and whose love could not have appointiMl more, affliction for them, than is requisite for the -purposes of his glory in their salvation.

If he do not know the particular design, which the Lord may more immediately have in view, in visiting him with his pre* tent distress of soul; let him study to have at leasts oC those ends of it gained upon him, whioh have been explained above. His duty is, to trust firmly in the Ixird Jesus, and also to pray frequently, that all the designs which God usually hath, ia thus ifflicting any of his children, may be obtain*-ed upon him. Perhaps, the particular intentioB of his spiritual trouble, is for a season, concealed from him; in order that, his heart may be set on having all the ends of the Lord, in that most afflio tive dispensation, gained upon him. <^ It is the glory of God to conceal a thing ^.'* ** Clouds and darkness are round about Him ^" And, therefore, though it is the duty of a holy man, to inquire into the Lord's principal design in hiding his face from him, tliat he nfoy in his exercise, strike in with that design ; yet, it becomes him to search into it, with the deepest reverence and humility; and not to be so disappointed if he succeed not^ as to sink lower in depression of mind, or to be deterred from any part of spiritual exercise* On the contrary, he ought, by the frequent exercise oC

every grace, imd the diligent peribrmanoe of every datjf to grow up into Christ in all things: and ha may warrantably hope that, in proportion as he is enabled to do so, the end, or ends of his mental troable, will be gained upon him.

CHAPTER VII.

OF THE MEANS WHICH, DISCONSOLATE BELIEVERS SHOULD EMPLOY, IN ORDER TO RECOVER THEIR SPIRITUAL COMFORT.

Spiritual consolation is a commodity of heaven, itot to be imported, but from that distant and bet*' ter country. It is God only, the God of all com-ibrt, to whom infinite mercy and power belong,' who can impart holy consolation to the sorrowful heart, or pour the balm of peace into the wounded spirit. It is only the adorable Spirit the Comforter, who, like Noah's dove, can fly with the olive-leaf of peace, to assure the troubled soul, *< that the winter is past, and that the rain is over and gone." When a holy man is walking in darkness, the day of comfort will not dawn, nor the shadows flee away, till ** the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings:" and he can no more command at his pleasure, the rising of the spiritual Sun, within, than he. can, that of the natural sun, without. AH that he can do is, in the strength of the grace whidi is in Christ Jesus,: io use means of recovering comfort, or, like tbef mariners in the ship with Paul^ to cust anchor, and wish for the day.

The means which he ought to employ for that purpose, must be means' of Divine appoiDtment, especially the following: *

J« He ought, in humble reUance on the grace of Christ, to search out, and confess to his heavenly Father, those iniquififs, which have prctVoked Him to hide his face from him. He must without delay resolve, as the Israelitish Church in captivity flid, to " search and try his ways, and to turn a^ gain to the Lord ; until the Lord look down, and behold from heaven ^." He ought to imitate David, who, when he was in distress of consciencei said to Jehovah, " I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid r I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. For thk shall every one that is godly, pray unto thee, in a time when thou mayest be found *." One special design of tlie Lord's hiding his face, sometimes, from many of his children, is, so to chasten them for some latent sins, in their hearts or lives, as to make them deeply sensible of them, and of the horrible malignity of them; in order that, they may attain deeper humiliation and self-abhorrence. The omniscient eye of God, hath seen all those secret evils, which, either have escaped their own notice altogether, or which, they have carefully concealed from that of others, while they could not but know that they were open to His view 5 and it hath also beheld, how much, his own glorious majesty, and spotless holiness, have been ^fronted and insulted by them. Hence are bis righteous

eren more heinous than the sin of devils;' for they never had a Saviour ofiered to them, nor a commandment given them, to believe in him. Ah! how inconceivably sinful is it, not to trust for salvation, in the Lord Jesus, the &ithful trustee of tliat everlasting covenant, which is well t>rdered in all things, and sure! Alas i why do -.not saints shrink vnth horror, from the first risings of: unbe-. lief in them^ as they would do, from a.temptatioa to commit murder, or any other enormous crime? Unbelief is the radical evil of the depraved heart, fi*om which, every other abominatioii issues.

They must without delay, study to become deeply sensible that$ the unbelief which prevails against them, and which passes in their minds, under the disguise of humility, and a dread of presumption, is,a most deep, dangerous, and destructive eviL : Their unbelief is the source^^to wUcb, every other departure of their hearts from the living God, may be traced. It is the principal cause of all their i^iritual trouble. What is it,*but their distrusting of Christ, and their . apprehending of God to be their enemy $ that increases the enmity against him, tlie deadness of • spirit, the hardness of heart, and the indisposition of soul, to meditate on him as a God of grace^ and to^pray to him, which they feel ? What is it, .but their fearing that he doth not love them^ and their apprdiending that he is laying «nares for theim or is watching for evil against them; that fills their :.90ulsi>with trouble and anguishi terror and dismayi

aversion from him, and weariness in every act pf service done to him ? Is it not their disbelief of his care, and their distrust of his mercy, that dispose them, to put a dark^ construction upon his dispensations to them, and to sink-even under the slightest pressures L Let the disconsolate Christian, thea, assure himself, tliat he Cannot attain holy comfort, until he be convinced that, his refusing to trust as a sinner in Jesus Christ, for salvation to himself, is'not only exceedin^y sinful in the sight of God, . but inexpressibly Am^ftd to himselfi-

S.' He should, iaiordcr to recover spiritual consolation, take heed that, he do not make rash and dnperate conclusions againsl himself^ respectii^ that which is either past, or present, or future.

He must, dierefere, strive against forming, rash ■ and sad conclusions against himself, with respect to that which is past.

to harden his heart, and to strengthen bis remaining enmity against the God of his salvation. The saints in Scripture, who had been guilty of that sin, did aftei*wards bitterly bewail it. When David liad said that he was cut off^ he informs us that he said it in his haste *. After Asaph had expressed, the thoughts of hi4> desponding soul, thus;

• *' Will the Lord cast off for ever ?" &c. he said, ••'This is mine infirmity^." The dejected Christian, then, mu«t beware of provoking in a still higher degree, the displeasure of God, by casting

■ away his confidence in the Redeemer, and givjng over himself as undone for eveF. If^ in the darkness ofspiritual trouble, he cannot discern evidences of his being in a state of grace ^ he ought on no ac-

4* He must, for the same }.urpose, call his soul to-a strid account^ for its dejection and disquietude, and charge it again and again^ to tnist in Jesus Christ, and in God through him*. .

He ouj^t witliout delay, to call his troubled so^ to an account. This was a mean of recover-ing-comforty which David employed, and which he did not employ in vain. When his soul was cast down, and disquieted in.hiui, he called upon,it to-i^ve an account of itself: *:* Why art thou cast down^ O my soul, and why art thou dii^quieted in me ^ ?" The grief of holy David, was not without a cause; and yet, it must not be-obstinate, nor exceed due boundsr It must not continue to depress and disquiet his soul^ andsoto discompose it, as tot disqualify it for the spiritual performance of present duty. ■■ The disconsolate believer ought, in -like manner, to commune with his own heart, and to call upon his soul to .assign a suiBcient. reason, - why it suffers itself to be disquieted, and cast do^n.. - He should call upon his troubled soul, to answer such. questions as these: < It^ the cause of this dejected, this despondent frame, a just one?

wilt say, I have good reasons indeed to be troab-Ifed, yea, to be so troubled, as to be disqualified for the acceptable p^ormance of every duty* But, hast tJiou suffkient reasons; such reasons, as wiU ^hdure to be tried, before the awful tribunal <yf Ae omniscient and righteous Judge of the worlds Have not other believers, as much cause as thoa, to be uneasy; who yet, .do not yield th^fnselves, as thou dost, to gloomy dejection, taaA to obstinate grief? Why shouldst thou be cast down^ as if thou h4(|st no grounds of hope or encouragement^ in the blessed gospel; as if thouhadst a God without mercy, a. Saviour without merit, a Comforter without & right of access to him, and trouble with* out a promise, either of support under it, or of deliverance from it ? Wilt thou be still miserable, and not know why ? Why, O my soul, dost thou, by thy despondency and sadness, dishonour thy God and Saviour, injure thyself^ and deter others from the way of holiness ?

Moreover, be should frequently charge Ihs disquieted soul, to hope in l3ie Saviour, and in 4Sod through Him.

ought to know and to consider, that these four \ things, the offer, the invitatioo, the cioninandmem to believe or trust in Christ, and the promise f being all addressed or directed to. hiiny as a sinner of Adam'^ race,—^form his. warrant, or afibrd him a right, to come as a sinner in himself, and with-. out a moments delay, to trust firmly in the Lord . Jesus for eternal salvation. He should study clear. }y to understand, that those, being founded on the , intrinsical sufficiency of tiie obedience and death of Christ, for the salvation even of all mankind, afford him, as a sinner of mankind, a sufficient right .or warrant, to come as he is; to come with, all bis .sins, all his wants, and all his griefe, and to rely .with assured confidence, on that Divine Redsenier, ibr romplete salvation to himself in particular. He ought to understand distinct^, that, as they are all .directed as particularly to him, as if Uiere was not another sinner in the woild, besides himself f so, ihey afford to him, a particular, a present, and t sufficient warrant, to confide, fQr^.all salvation to J)imself^ in Christ and in God through -Him $ that they afibrd to him a full right,, not indeed to believe that Chnist is already hia in possession; (his ^surance of this, must be founded on eviilences i) but— to trusty and to trust cordially, that Christ tnm giveih himself, with bi$. righteousness and sal* vation,.to him in possession. He must in order to recover true comfort, leigrn, spiritually and clearly to understand, that Christ's being his in qffir^ giveth him a right, to trust in him for possession^

The disconsolate Christian should likewise, have it firmly settled in his mind and conscience, that,

49 the great commandmtnt lo b^^^^qa theiuuneof

Jesus Christ, forms a main part of his revealetl warrant to trust in Him, so it makes it his duty to

' trust in him; and ihat, if it is his duty to trust in him for salvation, it cannot at the same time, be fais sin. He must labour to be fully persuaded, that his endeavouring to trust cordially and confidently, in the Lord Jesus for all his salvation, is

' not presumption or a sin ; but, that it is his present duty, yea, his first, his -principal, his greatest duty, without the performance of which, it will be impossible for him, to please God in any other duty \ It cannot, surely,'be presumption in him, to do that which God commandeth. Could the disquieted Christian be but convinced that, his distrust of the great Redeemer^ is his chief, his greatest sin, the source of all his other sins; and that, his trusting in Him forsalvation to himself, is his first duty, the principal of all his duties j it would be B sure step, toward his attaining of holy consolation. O that he but knew, what an unspeakable comfort it is, that the God of all consolation hath made it his €/t«^,his'first duty, to trust at all times, in' the infinitely oompassi^ttiHte Saviour! O that he would instantly and frequently try, to place the confidence of his. hearty ill Him for salvation ; and

' not stop a moment to look into himself, for any good qualification, to add to, or to strengthen that warrant for doing so, which the Lord bath graciously afforded him in his holy word !

things mentioned above, which afford tlie disoonao-late Christian, in common with all the other hearers of tlie gospel, a warrant, give hkn at the same time, an encouragement, to rely with confidence on tiie Lord Jesus. But there are various other things which, thoL^h they, strictly ^>eaj£ing, form no part of his revealed warrant; yet serve greatly,, wlien he properly considers them, to encoufnge him to trust in tlie Saviour..

He is troubled greatly, because he can discern no satisfying eW-dence of his being personally interested in Christ, and in God as a covenant-God. He is greatly a-larmed, and di^eply perplcxeiJ, because all his past cxpcritnce now a|Tpears to him, to have been counterfeit. I le finds that he is utterly unable of himself, either to perform spiritual duties, or to resist spiritual enemies. He is grieved, because he cannot approve the covenant of grace as he should; because he cannot trust cordially in Christ for salvation ; and because he is unable to exercise godly sorrow for the evils of his heart. He finds that he cannot rest upon Christ, and at the same time^ that he cannot rest or be easy without him. He desires the presence of God, and the light of hit gracious countenance; and he often fears that he is not sincere, in his desire of communion with him: he also mourns for the absence of God, and cannot be kept from him. He loves the company of the saints, more than that of others, lliose of his relations and acquaintance who appear uncon^ verted, he regards with pity; and he endeavoare to recommend the Saviour and his great salvation^ to their esteem.

Besides, the disquieted Christian should, for bis further encouragement to trust in Jesus Christ, and in God through him, consider frequently that he is not only commanded, in common with all other hearers of the gospel;, but that he is in a special manner commmauded, to trust in Him, •* Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, and walketh in darl^ness, and. hath no light? kt him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God ^:" as if Messiah, who is the speaker in the immediately preceding verse, had said to the professed members of th^ Israelitish Church, * Whoever is among you, though it were but one, who hath a sincere regard to the commandnients of the Lord, and a humble veneration for his high authority; who is also willing, to. listen attentively to the instructions, and to obey, sincerely the laws of me, his righteous servant j and who is in the darkness especially of spiritual trouble, without the light of deliverance or comfort; tell him that I have a special command, to lay, and to urge upon him:—r Let him trust; let him confide in the name of Jehovah ; yea, let him continue resolutely, to rely with firm confidence, upon his God, for all grace and consolation/ Although the believer, when he

EUhu's ^idior-tation to Job, when he was in darkness, is addressed also to him: ** Although thou sagrest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him 4 therefore trust thou in him ^J" He ought ^then to adopt without delay, the resolution of the holy Psaknist, and to say to the Lord,— *^ What time I am a-jraidj i will trust in thee ^."

my greatness, and comfort me on eoei^ side ^;" so that, as if he had said, * I shall in due time, s^ nothing dark or discouraging on any side.' The disconsolate Christian, should confide like^dse in the Father of mercies, the Goti of all comfort, and with the church of Israel, say, " My Goil will hear me: Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the Lord will be a light unto mc. He will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness. He will turn again, he will have compassion upon me ; he will subdue my iniqtiities; and he will cast all my sins into the depths of the* «ea \" He ought to trust even in a frowning abd withdrawing God 5 to trust Him, though-he cannot trace him, and, like the woman of Canaan, to be resolute and peremptory in trusting him.

Nor should he be afraid, that his endeavouriiTg thus to trust, is presumption. Presumption is urmai rantable or groundless confidence. It cannot then be presumption, so long as he is conscious that, he trusteth only in Christ and in God 5 and that, he places confidence in Christ and in God, ' not upon the ground of any good thing in his own heart or life; but only, upon the Divine warrant, which is afforded him in the gospel. Nor ought ^ he to fear chat he is acting presumptuously, so long as he is conscious that, he sincerely endea. vours to trust in the Saviour, not for a part merely, but for the whole of salvation; not for salvation in any sin, but for salvation from ex)ery sin; n#t for salvation, with sin, or to sin, but for that salva-

•tion, which comprises universal holiness of heart and life; not for salvation by his own righteousness, but for salvation by grace^ reigning through the righteousness of Jesus Christ, unto eternal life ^; and for salvation, not for his own glory, but for the glory of Christ, and of God in Him. Presumption ako is unreasonable confidence. But nothing can be more reasonable, than that a needy sinner come at the command of God, and trust with firm confidence, in Jesus Christ, for all that salvation which is laid up in Christ, laid out in the promise^ and brought near in the offer of the gospel. And nothing, on the coiitrar\', can be more unreasonable, than to trust for that which, it is impossible even for omnipotence itself, to aflbrd, and which, the Saviour hath never promised to give—salvation in sin—salvation, consistently with a man's retaining of some darling lust—salvation merely from the punishment of sin—salvation, in order to be at liberty to commit sin with impunity. In few

jwords. The disconsolate Christian should not fear, that his trusting in the Lord Jesus, for salvation to himself in particular, is presumptuous confi-

<<lence; if it is accompanied withy^ar, that he cloth not approve cordially, the whole scheme of redemption delineated in the gospel; with desire^ so to approve it; and with diligence^ in the use of all the other means of grace within his reach.

In his endeavouring to trust cordially in the blessed Saviour, for salvation, he must not overlook the promises of salvation. All the promises of

*Godf being in Christ, yea and Amen, are, in and

with' Christ, offered in the^gospd to^him. U)^ should, therefore, in applying Christ to bimsd^ embrace or apply the promises, not indeed sepa^ rate from Christ, but in and with Him ; imd be^^ lieving that the absolute promises especially, are^ in the ofi^, directed to him fbr his aocqitance^ be itiust rely on the faithfxilness of God in< them, iii4iich is pledged for the peribnnanoeof them; and-so, trust in Christ, for the performance of them tD himself, To- trust for salvation is, to rely, with con-fidence^ not-only cm Christ and hi& rightecnisness, but on the truth of the promises* It is to rely and live upon Christ, not as feh in the heart, but as oflered and promised in the gospel; andit must be of the same extent as the promises. The absolute promises of the eternal covenant, ore open* They ai« fvee. The disquieted Christian, therefore, should cast himself freely upon them, when feelings and evidences fail. He has been trying if he had already, a personal interest in Xhe^ Redeemer; and be has found no satisfying evidences of it in himsel£ Let him, for a little while, forbear that incpiiry^ and, in the mean time, put the matter out of doubt, by trusting that Christ now giveth him, a saving interest in Him. Eyery scriptural evidence of a personal interest in the Redeems, is either com^ prised in faith, or is a consequence of faith. Let his actings of faith in Christ, and in the promise, then, be distinct and express, in t)rder that, he may be conscious that he is acting it ^: and at* the same time, let him rest, not on the act, but on tfae.glori* ous Object', of his faith; and draw consolatiiHi^ not

Ta trust simply in. the Lord Jesus for saha-tioui to: himself^ is. the-principal mean, which the-disconsolate Christian-should employ, for attaining spirituals comfort. Without this^ no other means will: be of the smallest avaiL To rely \ritb'Cordiid and uDsnspectii^. affiance, vpcHi the faithfol He^ deemer, and the tree promises, is not only in itself^ an ease to thQ troubled soul^; but is, according to the coyenant of graoe^ the appointed'instrument of deriving consolation,, as well as holiness, from the fulness of Christ. After Job had said, *^ I know that my Redeemer liveth™," &c.*he was so relieved from the extremity of his trouble^ that he no more utteied such doleful complaints, as before. ** The Lord is my strength and my shield,'* says David, ** my heart /ni5^c^in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly refoicetky and with my soDg will I praise him ^.'^ Again, " I had fainted^ unless I had believed to see the goodness oi the Lord, in the land of the living °/' And again, " I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice •in thy salvation p," The Lord Jesus said to his disconsolate disciples, *< Let not your hearts be troiMed, ye believe in God, believe also in me **;'* If the disquieted Christianj then, would recover spiritual consolation, let him *^ hold the beginning •ofhis confid«ice, stedfast unto the end'/' Let Jrini come frequently to Jesus, the Consolation of

Israel, aiid come erery time, as if it were the first time, or, as if be were but beginning to come: let him come as a sinner in himself, and trust tiiat Christ will save him from his sin, and from hit trouble. So will the joy of God*8 salvation, be in due time restored to him. By thus casting all his care upon his gracious Redeemer, who capeth fiyr liim, his depressed spirit will become easy and. cheerful.

8. He must also for the same purpose, hope in,, the Lord Jesus, and in God as the God of all com-. fort. Spiritual hope, comprises a cordial deure and expectation of all promised good things, both in time and in eternit3\ It is a certain, and a longing, expectation of all the good of the everlasting covenant; and is grounded,.on tlie declaraticMis and promises of the goq)el; on the perfections of God in Christ, and his relations to his people; and on die office, righteousness, fulness, and intercession of Christ. It hath an inestimably precious object, and a heart-purifying and enlivening in« fluence *. It is a consequence of saving faith, and is inseparably connected with it. Faith, is a trusting that the faithful Redeemer, will perform all X\xQ promises of his eternal covenant tome: hope, is a desire and an expectation of all the future bless^ ingSj which are therein promised. It is a living principle, which revives and supports, strengthens and elevates, the soul of the true believer, .and which carries him l>cyond tliis finite scene, into that which is infinite; where he is transported with the joyful prospect of .life eternal, in the im-

'Now the dejected befiever should, for 'his comfort, endeavour Erequentlyto exercise this living hope; this << hope of an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and tihat fitdeth'not away,Teserved in heaven for him *.•* He must, in dependance on the grace of Chtist, facjpe for all necessary grace; and especially, ^^ for the grace that is to be brought unto him, at the Tevelation of Jesus Christ ".^ He ought to hope that the Lord will in due season, comfort him; ihat ^< the Ood of hope will yet fill Kim, with aH joy and peace in believing"^.'* He must, if he would recover holy consolation, diargc his sotil, as the Psabni6t did, to "hope in God ^;" to hope 'that he shall yet Irave comfort from God; that life •** shall yet praise him, for the salvation of his '"countenance,*** for the manifestation of his fevom* to his soul, and for the consolation which will ensue. He ought to hope even against hope, ** to hope continually," and " to shew 'diligence to the full assurance of hope, unto the end^.'' His Re--deemer is the great 'God, and he resolveth to act iik€ liimself. The believer should therefore expect great, as well as good things, from Him; great deliverances and supplies, great enlargements and consolations, great mercy and peace, and a great salvation *.

True hope is grounded, not upon that which the Christian feels in himself, but up<tt -that which Jesus felt in his siead; not upon what ihe doth for Christ, but upon what Christ did, and js still doing'for him. Evidences of grace in the heart and life, are indeed great encouragements to ezeixise hope; but they are not the grounds upon

9. Another mean of recovering spiritual coiofort, is dSigence in the ex^cise of toangelical repetUancfi* If jthe disoonsojate Christian would excarcase Tcpen* tanoet in an upright and acc^taUe manner; he iDiustt fint of jalli in the laith of pardonii]^ merc^» and of saneti^qg grace, repent of his^unbc^evingv distrustful, and deqponding thoughts, and nex<^ of all his other sins. His unbelief aod distrust of the Saviour, are his radical crimes; and ther^re, in his exercise of repentance, he ought to begin at them. And in order to exercise rq>entance sincerely and acceptably, he should trust that tiie Lord Jesus, the exalted Prince and Saviour,.£[n;tf/A repentance to him, and forgiveness of nns -^^ It is fiutb in pardoning mercy, that br^ks the hearty and that opens all the sluices of godly scmtqw for ain« Trusting, then, in the merc^ of the Lord Jesus Clurist, and of God in him % he shquJd en* deavobr to attun a true, ana a humbling sense of his iniquity. Without placing confideooe in re^ deeming mercy, a man may have a asQse ei siUf haXnci a true sense of it: he may have a sense of aki, as hurtful to himself^, but not as hateful to God ^; a sense of the danger and demerit, but npt of the deep malignity and pollution, of sin. The dqected Christian, therefore^ should study to at-

Let him turn from his sms of omission, and especially, from his sin of suffering liiinself to be discouraged, by a sense of the corruption of his nature, from the great duties of believing and rgoicing in Christ Jesus '; by which^ he hath brought up an evil report upon the good myB of the Lord. And he ought not to fear, that Mt repentance is legal or hypocritical, so long as he is conscious, that he endeavours to exercise godljiE sorrow for all sin, as sin, and to turn from itf because it is sin. The repentance of the legal* kt or hypocrite, is not so much, sorrow for sin. aa a sullen grief, that he is not allowed to sin with impunity ; not so much, a turning from sin to the Lord, as a turning from one sin to another *.

As the exercise of evangelical repentance, is an appointed mean, so it is a sure mean, of recover* ing holy consolation: for thus saith the Lord, *^ To» this man will I look^ even to him that is poor, and? of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word ^J* ''.The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and he saveth such as be of a contrite spirit ^."

10. He ought for the sam^ end, to mediiaiej» quentfy on the blessed Jesus, and on Grod as a God of grace in Him.

He is disposed to muse often on the trouble of his own mind $ but he should ratjier, contemplate ike stffferings qfChrisfs sotd* Were he frequentlf tp meditate on the unparalleled anguish^ the doleful agony, of his dear Redeemer's soul, when He wft enduring for him, the vindictive wrath of God» and was not allowed to discern ihe least amilje^ in the countenance of bi^ righteous Fathev^ k might be a happy mean of calming the tumult of his own soul. The compassionate Saviour, in love to him, and for his salyatipu, drank a cup of unmix^ wrath ; and he putteth into his hand, only a cup of suffering, mixed with many sweet and salutary ingredients. What are his sorrows, then, to those oC the Lord Jesus ? There is no compa-iison. There was more bitterness in one drop of Christ's sufferings, than in an ocean of his. Devout meditation on the loving, the agonizing, the dying Redeemer, hath often been a reviving, and a delightful, exercise to holy souls. ** My medita-^QJl of Him,'^ saith the Psalmist, <* shaU he

The disquieted believer should, moreover, think frequently on God in Christy n» a God of mercy and grace, and on his amiable perfections, and precious prctfoises. In Christ, God manifests himself to be 4 gracious, a promising, and a performing God y to be just such a God, as an afOicted saint would choose to have to do with. In Him, God exhi-bites his infinitely glorious excellencies, in the most amiable, attractive and encouraging point of view* He manifests himself, to be ^^ the Father of mer-ciesy and the God of all comfort.'^ To present Him «ikei| to the mind, therefore, in that point of view^ Willy in the liand of the adorable Comforter, be a sovereign cordial to a drooping spirit.

know, that it is better to ^^ seek the Lord/' than Uf ^d all things else. * When the afflicted believer is praying, he mnti endeavour to praise and thank the Lord. Tlis al-^ so, is ar special mean of recovering holy consolation. We read, in a passage of scripture, cited rix>ve, tliat the Psdmist said to hi» dejected soul, ^i Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise, him ^ f!*-as if he had said, ^ I hope yet to-praise him: E long to praise him.' This grateful and adorinjp irame, was not only an evidence of David's begin-: ning to emerge out of tlie depth of. his trouble; but was likewise a mean^of his emerging. The depressed Christian, then,, if he would attain qiiritual com* fort, should study in hia prayers, to occupy at least as much time, in. thanking the Lord for the mercies vouchsafed to him, as in confessing the sins committed by him. This would tend greatly^ tp remove hi& bitterness of spirit, and to brin^ re* freshing consolation to his weary soul. Thefire* quent mentioning of things, that, are sweet and gheering, is a mean of sweetening the temper of the mind, and of promoting che^&lness of spirit* Were the disquieted believer, to take special notice of the manifold blessings, which are still vouchsafe cd to him, and frequently to- bless the. Lord for them ; - he would not remain long after, in an uncomfortable frame \ . He ought therefore to esteem it his privilege, as weU as his duty, in every condition, to give thanks to God ^ He should be thankful that, his heavenly Father condescendeth to be angry with him, and to reprove him for sini

Although be has no prospect of deliverance soon, yet let him ^till wait, until the time to- &vour him, even the &# time be come $• and wait, with a patient and silent: sesignatiou to the Divine will*', '^^he Lord is waiting for the very same day of comfort, for which, the disconsolate saint is to wait $ and if the Lord cannot be disi^ppointed, so neither can be. There is in the love of Christ to him, an earnest' kinging, as it were, that the day might oome. And therefore he may, in submission to the: wiU of his gracious Gad, lawfully pray, as the htAy FaalmisU did^, even for a^^^^^deUveKance.

Hm is tfae'Lord V I have waited for him, I shall be glad and rc^ice in his salvation ^/' The longer be stays in expectation, for spiritual consolation, the sweeter and purer, at length, will the enjoyment Qf it prove. Let his patience then be the *^ pa* tience of hope.'' It is hope, that giveth life and vigour to patience. He must not sufier his exercise of patience to be interrupted, either by fret-ing himseli^ or by betaking himself for comfort, to any creature. He should not fret himself in any wise; but should, with humbleness and calm<* Bess of qpirit, wait upon the Lord. Let him firmly resolve to wait God's time^ and to bear Iiis firown *; in humble expectation, that He will all length, return and visit him, with the light of his countenance,, and with the joy of his salvation.

IS. It is ako requisite, in order to recover true comfort, that, a holy man be constantly on his' guard, against Riding to imy motion of sin^ in his heart; and that, he be pressing an toward mon jholiness of heart and of life.

He must, in depesdance on the promise of saniw tification, always take heed, that h% donot tpM to IMaiy secret motion ef sin in his heart If he wouU lutve his conscience pacified and peaodui, he most atrive to keep it pure. Sin, like Achan in the camp, or Jonah in the ship^ is that which causetk iKoublew If the disconsolate believer allow himself^ |br a season^ to jidd to any motion of sin, or temptation of Satan, or of the worU,. he cannot be «a«y or comfortabfe in hit mind. Althongh a tra-wUev wese sura that he was to leaeh^ in safety^

the place to which he was going; yet if he tra* relied with a thorn in his foot, he could not but be sensible of pain, at e\'ery step. If the Christian suffer himself to connive, especially at that' in himself, which he knows to be wrong; he can-' not but be disquieted. Uprightness-and singleness" of heart, are necessary to his recovering of lost comfort. God hath made - an eternal separation,'' between continuance in the love and practice of any* sin, and holy tranquillity of mind: Let therefore the afflicted believer, in' the faith that Christ wilV strengthen him, maintain a resolute and continual struggle, against the first risings, the secret mo-^ tions, of depravity in his heait; It- is* as • natural for sin indulged, to raise and iiicrense doubts and fears in his mindj as for rotten wood to breed worms. Every instance of his yielding to a motion of sin, will be like a blot upon his evidencesr . for heaven. Let him, then, in all his conflicts witb the risings of sin, diligently study, both to discoveri and to mortify, the corruption ofhis-nature ; both to sigh under the burthen^ and to act against the power, of the sin that dweHeth in him. It should always be his manner, to attack and mortify sini in its Jirst risings: for, as that which usually de^ stroys his peace of conscience, is his indulging of corrupt desires; so his constant endeavour, through grace, to resist and quell them, before they have time to acquire strength, is a sure mean of recover* ing spiritual comfort

He should also endeavour: daily, to attain more and more holiness o£ heart and life. True holineM consists, of loving the Lord our. God supremely, of

and of studying habitually to serre him wiih glad--ness ^y aa weQ as with abhorrence of all iniquity. Spiritual comfert accordingly is a part of holiness*-The more, a believer advances in universal holiness^ the more o{ the principle and i&a&i^of pureconsola* tion, does he possess $ and the more of the principle and habit of this holy comfort, he attains, thei more of the enjoyment of it, shall he have in every, time of need. The disconsolate Christian, then,. to the efid &at he may recover sensible comfort, should, by failh,. receive out of the fulness of Christ, greater measures of sanctifying grace; that he may, not only die daily to sin, but live to^ righteousness. He ought, from principles of faith-and love, and for the glory of his redeeming God^^ to become more and more diligent in all the duties of hcdiness. This, though it shall not merit coiv-solation for him, yet, will in his experience be coir-. Bected with consolation ; yea, it will itself be a comfort to him. <^ Our rejoicing is this,''' saith an Apostle-,^'^ the testimony of our conscience, that, in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the worlds." To be advancing sensibly, in conformity to the Lord Jesus, and in holy activity for his glory, cannot fail to be very pleasing and encouraging to a holy man. Although die beginning of comfort in the soul, is necessary to the practice of true holiness; yet, the pracMce. of holiness, is requisite to the increase of comfort^ and to the recovering of it, after it hath in any measure been lost''. Let it» then, be the ardent

desire of the believer's sou], and the settled purpose of his heart, to advance daily, in the love and pcao-tiee of universal holiness. Let perfection of holiness, be the ruling wish of his. heart, and the-great purpose of his life, to which he uniformly directs aU his efibrts. Let his will be always, in unioa with the will of Christ, and with the glory of Grod; dnd then, Christ *^ will give him the desires of his heart':'' then, he shall know by experience, that a supreme regard to the will, and to the glory of Gody is, the health and happiness of the souL

14. As a mean of attaining the spiritual comfort which he desires, the Christian, if he be capabk^ mvk9t perform diligently^ the duties tfhi$ lauDfidcaU' ing* Though this forms a part: of the holiness mentioned in the particular immediately preceding]^ yet the special importance of it, as a mean of CQSOf fort, requires that it be considered by, itselC Let the disconsolate believer take care, that he regfxi idleness, as a continued omission of the duty, ve> quired in the eighth* commandment of the moral law; and that he abhor it, as a continued crime^ and as a reproach to his holy profession K To be idle, even for a single day, without real and evi^ dent necessity, is dangerous to any Christian $ bat especially, to a Chmtian in trouble of conscience^ It is a tempting of Satan, to come and find employment for him ; and it is a leaving of himsdf at leisure, to weigh, one after another, the temp* tationa of that subtile, and malicious enemy. A Heathen philosopher terms idleness, < The grave of a living man;' and a holy minister of the

gMpd 9tyh» it, ' The hell of a living Christian.* Let the ditquieled Christian then, lieoonstantly upon hi« guard against idknesB, and especially against a disposition to be idle. Let his heart, as well as bis hands, be exerdsed, in a voluntary and diligent peribmiance of the various duties of some honest, and useful vocation ; otherwise, his heart will woric out of itself, a still greater degree of trouble to him. Idleness fi*eds, and increases, the distemper of a tronhled soul; whereas, lawful enployment occu* pies the mind^ and takes it off from poring inces* saBtly, upon the causes and a^ravations of the trouble. When Elijah the prophet, was in de-prteiioq of mind, the Lord would not sufler him to sit still in any place. When he sat down under a Juniper-tree, ^ an angel touched him, and com* jnanded him to arise and eat;*' when he again lay down, the Angel of the Lord, a second time, roua* ed him to action. When he went to a cave at Ho* rebf in order to lodge there, *^ the word of the Lord came to him, and said, What dost thou here, £lijah ? Go forth^ and stand upon the mount before the Lord." Soon afterwards, when he was standing in the entrance to the cave, the Lord again disturbed his repose^ and said to him, ** Cio return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus K'^ If it is a Christian's duty, even wb^ he is under the disease of melancholy, to be diligent in business $ it is no less his duty, when he is troubled in soul^ merely on a spiritual account. He must not therefore say, either that he is disinclined to work, or that his trouble is so great, that be h UPllble Xq

work; uiitilhe first, be well satisfiied from the Orav des of truth, that such excuses will be sustained at the tribunal of Christ, the omniiBcient, and righteous Judge of the world. The Holy Comforter hath, in wonderfid condescension, visited with the joy of his salvation, many thousands-of his saints, at the very times in which, irom regard to his authority, they have been employed in the business of their several callings.

15. If he have reason to apprehend that he is, in any degree, under melancholy, which, as has been observed above,, is a bodily disease $ he should frequently ifitrwt his imagination^ to the blessed Redeemer, that sovereign Physician of soul ao^ body, in the hope that He will cure the distemper of it So long as the imagination continues weak and disordered, it will present to the understanding, eveD the most encouraging, and amiable objects, in a distorted, discouraging, and unamiable form i and so long as that is the case, trouble of mind, orsad** ness of spirit, must in a greater ov less degree, con-Ikiue. The melancholy Christian therefore should^ not only trust in the compassionate Saviour, for consolation to his troubled soul $ but he should, in the use of other appointed means, trust that, solar as it can subserve the gbry of God in his salva« tion, Jesus will deliver him from the distemper o£ his natural spirits. He ought to trust in the great Redeemer, for the health of his badyf which is the temple of the Holy Spirit °^, as well as, for the happiness of his soul; in order that both soul and l^Kjdy may be prepared, to " serve the Lord with

gladness." He 48 fully warranted to rely with firiA confidence, on the Lord Jesus, for all that is necessary to enable him to glorily Gk>d, in his body^ and in his spirit, which are God's ^.

16. To disclose the condition of his sotd^ to soYnd experienced and judicious Minister, or private Christian, is also a mean of recovering tranquillity of mind, which, the disconsolate believer should not fail to employ. He ought, if possible, to select for this purpose, some holy and humble Minister, or private Christian, who had himself been in trou-Ide of mind, but has mercifully been delivered from it; and who appears now,..to be <;onfinned in &ith, and to be filled with joy and peace in believ-iag. He should without deky, discover the condition of his soul to such a one. He ought to reveal to him, as fully and distinctly as he can. What It is, that more immediately troubles and depresses his' mind ; what it is, that makes him conclude himself, to be yet unregeneratc, and l)is former ex-^rience, to have been but counterfeit; what the grounds of his present doubts and fears, are; and jespecially, why he cannot trust in the infinitely com-p'assionate.Saviour, for salvation to himself in particular. H&should, if he can with prudence, hint to such a one, the sin or sins which, he apprehends, have provoked the Lord to plead this controversy •with him ; in order, ^hat he may afford him an op-■ portunity, of speaking pertui^tly to his condition •. -*« When I kept alence,''-saith David, " my bones .waxed old, througKmy roaring all the day long p ;" uis if he had said, < The sin which^ i did not freely

" .1 Cor. vi. 20. • James v. 16. p Ps. xxxii. 3.

ud ingenuously confess to the Lord, and also to persons skilful in aswaging trouble of mind| rankled inwardly, and occasioned uiiq)eakable anguish in my soul.' The affliction of the soul, as well as thfyt of the body 9 should be made known to such a fellow-Christian, as appears qualified to suggest sutta* ble advices, and encouragements; to the end diat, these may be' afforded seasonably, as means of relief. When the Holy Spirit comforteth a dejected saint, he doth it usually, by the instnimentBdity ilT some other saint If the disconsolate behever, be providentially favoured witii an opportunity; to open the case of his soul to another believer $ the Holy Comforter will very seldom, in an immecEate manner, create peace to him: He usually *<cr^tei ihefrmt of the lips^ peace '.'* He will comfort him, by means of the presence and the speech of than, whom he hath comforted, and so qualified to be instruments of consolanon to him '• Faitbfiil Ministers of the gospel, especially, are helpers di ihe Christian's joy. But how can liiey be helpful ,to it, in the case of a disquieted Christian, who -stands most in need.of their help, if he do not aflbrd •them an opportunity ? How can they answer objections, resolve doubts, or loose, as one ex|)resses jt, the knots of conscience, if these be not proposed to them ?

Moreover, the disccmsolate believer, should not forget to request the fervent prayers, not only of him, to whom* he has disclosed the condition df bis soul, but of Qtlier Christians, with whom he is /u:quain^. Spme have observed that, those be-

** Isa. Ivii. 19. ' 2 Cor. i. 5.

Severs, in former timesy who were the most accns-tomedy to request the aid of each other's prajersi, were commonly the most flourishing Christians; Mid that, those who neglected this part of their duty, were usually the most languishing and hesitating. If *^ the effectual fervent prayer,'' evea of one *< righteous man, availcth much *;" hoiy much more, will the prayers of many such, avail ^! ]7. Finally, If he would attain pure consolation, be nnust not expect it from the rneansj which it Is his duty to employ. Let him use diligently, all the means of Divine appointment, and especidUy, those explained above; but let him take heed, that he do not trust in them, nor in bis using of them, for tihe smallest degree of comfort. He ought to us^ diem as diligently, as if he were to merit by it, not merely spiritual consolation, but even eternal life; and at the same time, to trust as little in tbem, and in his use of them, as if he had never known nor used, so much as one of then. His employing of them is a duty, which he is bound to rogard, in point of performance, and to renounce, in point of dependance. He is, in his constant uae of them, to rely for consolation, only upon the Lord Jesus, and upon Ood in Him, .as the God of all comfort". If he would recover a peacefyl serenity of mind, he must renounce all confidence in his use of means, and expect consolation only from his God and Saviour: saying, <* Ashur sh^l Qot save me ; neither will I say any more to the work of my hands^ Ye are my gods. What have





* James v. 16. * Acts xii. 12. ** Ps. Ixii. 5.

I to do any more with idols ^ ? He may Gxpeet aH necessary -comfort, in his diligent use of the iheans; b(it no comfort, ,^t>»i it. He must net presume to think, that his utmost diligence in em* ploying them, will give him, -either a meritorioosp xsr a pactional, title to holy consolation. Spiritual comfort is a free gift, a gift of grace; and all the appointed means of attaining it, are means of grace. There is, indeed, a tendency in those means, to comfort the disquieted bdiever, who dUigently uses them: it is not, however, any virtue in them^ nor in his use of tliem^ but it is the power of the Holy Spirit accompanying them, that imparteth -all the comfert He ought not, therefore, as -Christians in -spiritual trouble, too often do, to pro* mise himself relief, by such and such a duty, at this or that time, or place: for if his expectatioB be not answered, (and it would indeed be a wonder if it should,) he will be ready to conclude, that the promise of God faileth, and that the disappoint" ment, especially if repeated, is a sure indication, that the Lord hath cast him off for ever. This, instead of bringing peace or comfort to his troubled soul, will contribute greatly, to phmge it into still deeper perplexity, and to enchain it the &8^ er, under perturbation and terror.

Thus, I have endeavoured to point out the means, which the disconsolate believer should chiefly employ, in order to regain his spiritual comfort. If he persevere in the diHgent use ef them, and in complying with the advices concent ing them, given in this Chapter; he shall, through

^ Hos. XIV. 3, 8*

grace, as soon as it will subserve the glory of his <7od and Saviour, and the sanctification of his owa soul, recover holy consolation. He perhaps may never, whilst he remains in this valley of tears, ex« perience nqOurousjqy $ but he shall, by the grace of the Lord Jesus, recover solid tranquillity, and sweet satisfaction of mind* *' In hc^ of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, promised hefofe the world began ^,'' his soul, by the consoling in-* fla^ices of the Holy Comforter, shall enjoy a cahn and pleasing resignation, in all things, to the holy will of his redeeming God.

From the foregoing particulars, it appears dearly, that disconsolate saints have no allowance from the Lord Jesus, to re/use to be comforted, or to harden themselves in sorrow. The holier any of the saints -are, they are, when under desertion, usually the more troubled. The more they love their God and Saviour, the more does it trouble them 4x> want the light 6f his gracious countenance; the more are they afraid lest they «in, and the more are they troubled because th^y have sinned; the more are they disquieted by a sense of his paternal displeasure, and the more are they overwhelmed by the dread of his avenging wrath. Still, how« ever, they must not yield to despondency, nor harden themselves in sorrow ^; but, on the contrary, they should exert themselves, in usii^g the means of attaining holy tranquillity of mind. To pei;si||St obstinately in refusing to be comforted^ will pro-< voke the Lord to proceed in the controversy, and

« Tit. I. 2. yJobvi. 10. '

to sink their souls still deeper, in the waters of trouble.

Ought thebdiever, when he is troubled m mindi diligently to search out the pfaiticular mt or iViSi #hich have provoked his heavetily Faither, td hidb his £eic^ from him ? Let him nbt hed6e corickid^ diat h^ will, in that condition^ suec^M m scKkrdiii^ fb'i* his graced, or ^videne^ of p^fhM^'al ihteriSstiB e^rlsf; Whilst hfe is waUdtig in the datkij^ ^ i^lritiial trotibl&j it ^ill hk to little purptK^ ftr fiim t6 spend' His tiiti^, in searchihg for ^ic^enoa of his being in a state of graiie: for diiriiig tktd time, they are wrapped iip in darkness, and cannot be discern^. He niay i(doiii^ Expect, to ^ his £ce in troubled waters, than to see bis evidencei ibr beaten, when his soul is troubled and covered with dai^chess. The only thing, which be can at that timcj do to good purpose, is, to intrust tbe salvation of his «oul to Jesus Christ, and to trust ilfid* plead absolute promises. Times of desertioB and of temptation, are rather seasons for mournings, arid trusting; and seeking the Lord, than forjudge ihg tfa^ sitftt^ of the soul. To search at such times, fbr ribmaihing corruption^ in the heart, is one of the fiiednid of recovering spiritual comfort; but to try to fhld evidcntes of grace in it, when they are veil-^ with darkness, is the way to sink the deeper, in tfie waters of trouble.

Is trusting in Christ, the principal mean ofre-c()^rlf)^ spiritual consolation? Let the disconso-Me Christian, then, be exhorted and entreated to trust hi- Hiih. O let him endeavour, to cooJte anew, to come without delay, to come as a sinner, to ^come with all his biixtheaS) all his griefi, all his

Oif he could but be persuaded, tardy 1th asiBUi'ed confidence on the Lord Jesus, peace wl joy9 would soon be restored to his troubled td I He would find the exercise of trusting in kriet^ to be most profitable to himself, and most sasing to God. O Christian, trust resolutely in > blessed Redeemer, and persist in trusting, till cnlbrt come. Apply promises and tdcethe com-t ctf them. Suck, and be satisfied with those »EWts of consolation.

But some dejected Christian will say, < I see no ki that J iave, to trust in Christ for salvation to raelf; and tlier^ore it would be presumption in )^ BO much as to attempt it.' To this I would swer: You conclude, it would appear, that you re no right to trust in him; because you can at esent, see no good qualifications in yours^, to NS you a right. But you were informed above, It your right to trust in Christ for salvation, is r founded upon any good quality in yourself;

tf «ipon the offer, the call, the ckmuttaAdtnetit t«

believe on his name, and the promise; all direct-edy in the gospel, to you as a sinner of mankind. These afibrd you, an ample, a perfect, a suffideot, warrant to believe in him; and nothing in yoin^ self, can render that warrant more complete, thia it already is. It is nothing within you, but itii those things in the gospel without you, that^ you all the right that you need, to trust anew k Jesus. To say, then, that you have no right to intrust your salvation to him, or, that it would be presumption in you to trust him, is direct unbs-UeC Whether you believe -itor not, you havc^ia the go^>el, a full, an unchangeable right, to tmit as a. lost sinner, in the almighty Saviour, for aO your salvation. And nothing which is good in yoursdf, can afford you the smallest right; for al that is good in you, is either in faith, or codm-quent on faith ; but nothing of it can hejireoiom to faith.

Another, perhaps, is ready to Sf^, ^ I caniu^ trust in Christ, for I know not if I be elected to salvation.' You cannot know that you have bees elected, till after you have trusted in him. Ygnr election to salvation, forms no part of your revealed wiurrant, to truist in Jesus for salvation. Yont warrant is that which was mentioned above. Y(Xt ignorance then of your election, cannot lesMS that warrant, and your knowledge of your electioO} cannot add to it. The offers and invitations d the gospel, are not directed to men as dect ais-ners, but—as sinners of mankind. Akfaouglii therefore» you do not know, that you are a sinntf elected; yet, since you know, that you are a aio-jier of Adam's xace^ the offers and caUs are address

As you cannot know, you are elected, before yon venture to trust in st $ so neither can you know, that yon are noi id. Your present duty therefore is, to ap-*h, and, upon the ample warrant afibrded yon B gospel, to trust firmly in the Lord Jesns^ 1 salvation to yourself in particular. So shaH by believing and walking in Him, know your on of God. Yon can never know, that God ordained you to eternal life, otherwise, than lowing e3q)erinicnlaUy, that he hath ordained o believe *• Yon are bonnd to believe, brf<ve mow your particular election, and' in order to ' it; and also, because it is the will of God, irou should believe.

Trust that he h you an interest, in order to see andfeel^ that ith given it. The more ignorant you are, of interest in the Saviour, the more need you to trust, that he granteth you a saving interest imself. You must not excuse yoursdf from ing for it, because you do not see and feel that have it; but you ought to trmt for it, in order e and feel that you possess it. Instead then^

of saying, * I dare not confide in Jesus lor salVa-tion, because I fear that I hare no interest i^ salvation i' you should, on the contrftryi iiay, * Because I Iiave a revealed warrant to do it, I will cordialiy trust, that He giveth me salvatioD, and that bs will in due time, favour rae with a sense of mj personal interest in it.' You must not seek te ieel, in order to believe ; but you are to believe, ia order to feel *.

Another, perhaps, will be reasoiaiBg tibua, ' All I who believe in Christ, rely upon i}^ prooodiaesi but ! no promise so comes to me, as to be impres$tidmA jxrwer on my mind: proomsea fure mot givoi ipe, a^nd diere&re it woidd be pr^sumptioii in m% to apply them and rest upon them.' You msgm li^ think that, a powerful impreasipn qf aosne promiiA on a man's mind, ia tlie ground of his nght, tP take and to trust that psomise; and that, bfwise you experience no such impression of 9Py pr^ nuse, you have no right to apply any. iBut jiljfi woukl be, to build your &ith, upon your^Jsaffi^ of the promises; or, to make the sensiUbe imprfgwoa of them upon your mind? your ground of ar^^tP apply and trust them. A powerful impresaion of a pi'omise, made by the Holy Spirit, :upon your mind and memory, in a time of need, is indeed an encouragement to you, to apply and trust that promise; but it forms no part of your marrani todo IQ» It is the ^er of all the promises, in and with Christ to you, and the call and command to acQspt that o& fer, that alFordyou a right, to trust in Him, and to apply and trust all the promises in him. The ior

* Eph. L 13^

ward impression cannot add to, and the want of it, cannot lessen your warrant. Your duty then is, to apply and trust the promises, not as powerfully suggested to, or impressed on your mind, but as offered or directed to you, in the gospel. One reason, perhaps, of your not being favoured with comfortable impressions of promises, is, your not liaviqg trusted in the Holy Comforter, for such im--pressions; and your not having honoured the promises themselves, by trusting them, upon the Divine warrant which lies in the word without you. Know then that, in order to holy consolation, you must study to trust Divine promises, not upon the ground of their being impressed, but upon that of ^jl^ being offered to you.

Some other disconsolate soul may be saying, ^'Alas,.! have a dead, hard, and deceitful heart, which greatly discourages me fi'om trusting, that the holy One of God, will ever visit me with his salvation. How can I hope, that he will save and comfort such an uncommon sinner as I am ?'. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all accept tation, that Christ Jesus c^me into the world to save sinners ^ of whom, says our Apostle, I am chief**. Now you should accept, or believe that faithful saying, with application to yourselr, and say, ' It is indeed true, that I am an uncommon sinner, yea, the very chief of sinne;rs j but it is equally true, that Christ Jesus came into the wor{d to save such sinners, and why not—to save me? My heart, alas, is very dead, hard, and deceitful; but.the cleeper, the depravity of it is, the-more,.

will the power and graee of Christ be glorified, in Having ine from tlvat depravity. I will therefore venture to trust, that He will glorify the exceeding riches of his grace, in saving me from all the sin that dwellcth in me, and from all the hiiquity that has been committed by me/ It is your duty, to humble and to loath yourself much, for the evils of your Jieart, and of your life; but it h yonr sin, to let them discourage j'ou in the least, from al-tempting any one of your duties. You ought, indeed, to be humbled for them, in the greatest degree ; but you mt|st not be deterred by tjhem) even in the smallest degree, from your duty, especially, from the first and great duty of believing in Jesas Christ. If you be, in your own sight, the chief of aimiers; even this, must not discourage you ftom the chief, the first of all duties. The deeper, yonr sense of the plague of your heart, is, this should, instead of discouraging you^ excite yott the mmtj to perform diligently the duty of trusting iii Christ, especially for sanctification*-

One, it may be, will be saying, ^ Why should! be cxhortied to trust in Christ ? I have, times whft-out number, been guilty of backsliding, both ininy heart, and in my life. I have frequently resolved to be more circumspect, and more diligent in the spiritual performance of every duty; but I have, upon the very slightest temptation, acted contraiy to my resolutions, by relapsing, once and again, into the same sin,* You have, indeed, much reason to exercise godly sorrow, and self-abhorrence; but, no reason to be so dismayed, as to cease trusting- ai the Saviour, or to be so dejected, as to refuse to be comforted^ You. bov^ xa\i^\v weed to exercise re-

■pentanoe; but, as much need to ^ercise that re^ liance on Christ, from which, true repentance flows: and it is as great a sin, to suffer your backsliding to deter you from the latter, as from the former. No past sin, however aggravated, must be pled in excuse, for omitting a present duty. "The LfOrd hath graciously promised, to keep you flpom total and final backsliding ; but, nowhere, as fiur as I know, to secure you against patfial bacb--aliding, or against relapsing, in the hour of temptation, into the same sins of infirmity, of which you have formerly repented. Abraham was suffered, again and again to dissemble; Lot, to be twice overcome with wine; John, to be twice guilty of worshipping, the angel; and Jchosapbat, >lo join affinity with Ahab, and afterwards^ to join himself with Ahaziah king of Israelj who did very wickedly. It is not indeed usual with God, to leave his dear children, to relapse often into|pioi^ iinous transgressions; but he su£fers them, for their bumiliation, to relapse into sins of infirmity. Though your backsliding, then, should humble you to the dust; yet it should not, for a moment, diis-eourage you,'from the great duty of trusting in -Jesus Christ. Hearken to these gracious, these cheering invitations:—*< Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the Lord,-and-1 will not cause mine "anger to fieill tipon youV^ ** Return, ye backsliding diildren^ and I will heal your backslidings <^«V Apply^ tmd trust, and pleads tliese consoling promises:*-^* Iwilt heal tbeir backsliding, I will love Ihem freely<^:" ** Twill seek that which was lo8t>

Another may he ready to say, * How can my iieart, which frequently revolte from Ood, be uf^ right before him ? How can that heart be sound,, which is often sore ? I have bewailed .ray sin, and nsolved against it; but no sooner am I tempted to it, than, alas, I often fall before the temptation. Indeed, I have much reason to dread, that I shall, one day, perish by the hands of sin and Satan.' Your bewailing and striving against your sin, are Ji good evidence that, though sin sometimes prevails against you, yet it does not reign in yea; that, though it rebels, yet it does not rukb It is a willing obedience to the commands of the body of ain, which evidences the soul to be under the domi-Jiiqpi of sin.

Some discouraged soul will be saying, * How can I venture to trust, that the holy Jesus wiU perform the part of a Saviour, to me, when I know that my iniquities against him, are imiumei-af^le, and aggravated in an uncommon degree ?* For that very reason, you ought to be the more dispose^ . and the more determined, to trust.in him.fQr.^-.

You must permit me to ii^form ^ you, that, so far fts your desire of salvation.from the love and practice of iniquity, is sincere^ you do resolve to rely upon .Him for that salvation.

In proportion as jojti do not fully .resolve, and endeavour, to trust in the Lor^ Jesus for salvation from your sins, you Uwe them ; and your complaiuing of the number,and theg^eat* .ness of them, is hypocritical. Besides, your ta^« ing occasion from your innun^erable and great transgressiQ^s, to say, * I dare not trust in the .holy Jesus, for salvation,' shews,that, you are wish-

your life, to entitle you to trust in him. This, evidences the dreadful prevalence of a self-righteous spirit, as well as of unbelief, in you^ Yea should consider that, the salvation of Jesus Christ, is infinitely free; and that, the more numerous^ and the more heinous, your sins are, the more need you have of Him and of his salvation, and there-ibre the greater need to believe m him. If yon could suppose, that the omnipotent Saviour, did never yet perform such a great work, as the saving of a sinner from sins, so innumerable, and so great as yours are; even this, could be no Just obstacle to your trusting in Him; because the depth of his immense love, hath never yet been soand-ed S and the greatness of his ability to save^ hath never yet been searched out. He hath nevef yet 'done the utmost that he can do. Suppose the mountain of your innumerable sins, were so high, as, with its height, to reach, not only the cfouds, but th6 throne of the Eternal Himself; suppose that, and another, and ten thousands of them, were piled lip, and the whole cast into the abyss of redeeming Ibve, and redleeming blbod $ the waters of that bottomless, that boundless ocdin, would still be as high above them, as the heavto fs high above the earth".

Another perhaps is sayingji * I do not doubt the ability, but the mUingness'otXiTirist, to save me from my great transgressions.* If you believe his ability, yiDu do in ihisame Aegtee, believe his Willingness : for, what is his willingness to sav^ sinners, but'his mor&l abilTty.

Why doth he offer himself to you ? why doth he invite, beseech, and even command you, to accept and trust in him for your salvation ? and why doth he say in his promises to you, ^< I*mill^^ but because be is willing to save you. Would he ever have made it your duty, to believe in him for salvation; or would he ever have said to you, ^* He that beiiev-eth not shall be damned ^" if he had not been willing to give you salvation? \yould he ever have aaid, '* Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out ;** or have complained that sinners *^ would not come to him, that they might have life;" if he had been unwilling, to receive and save them ? Indeed, to disbelieve his willingness, is to: make him—a liar; to say that he is not willing to save . you, is, to blaspheme the kindness of his redeemr-ing love, and the riches of his glorious grace. If you think, that he is willing to save other sinnepsy but not to save you; know that, this is one. of Satan's whispers, entertained by your evil heart of imbelief; and that, it is not more injurious to the infinitely gracious Redeemer, to doubt even of his existence^ than to doubt of bis willingness, to save H lost sinner.who desires to trust in him.

It is, indeed, in the hand of the Spirit, a mean of rendering a man willing to .trust in the Lord Jesus, and the more of it he attains, be is the more willing; but it affords him, up diegree of warrant to.trust in him: nor is it re« quifite that it should.

You are not only iar, but infinUely^ far, irom being able to deserve Christ and his great salvation* But it seems, you wish that you coidd deserve salvation, or at least, that you could merit the Saviour himself; or, if not salvation, nor the Saviour f that you could but merit the good will of the Saviour, and could so recommend yourself to ^his favour, as freely to claim and trust in him..

Do you think it possible, that Christ the inestimable gift of God, can be purchased with the money of your merits; or, that you can procure a title to that salvation, which is wholly of sovereign grace ? Suppose you offered, but a single good thought for it 5 would not even that, mar the freeness of it, and obscure the ^lory of immensely rich grace, in tjiegift ofit? Ah! Why do 3'ou try to find a cause in yourself, why the Lord Jesus sbouki save you ? Why do you seek to make merit, the object of re» deeming grace and mercy ?

Another disconsolate soul is saying, * I.cannot. trust in Jesus for my salvation: I have no abilibi to believe in him/ That is a common objection,, but it amounts just to this;—a complaint that, liowever much Christ hath done for you, he bath .not yet, advanced you to a state of iqdependence on himself, nor set you free from your incapacity of doing any thing without him. But why should this be a ground of complaint ? He knows that you cannot, by any power of your own, believe, ift so much as think one good thought;, and yet, he commands you to believe on him.

To conclude: A Christian, under extreme dejection of spirit, will be ready even to say, * In my present doleful condition, I find myself ndther able nor wiUing^ \o trust in Jesus for^ salvati«nt' What!—Are you not willing to trust in Him ?— Bot willing, to be saved and eomforted by him ?— not wilUng, to afford him an opportunity of shew-ing, in your salvation, the exceeding riches of his gi*ace ? He, with all bis salvation, and with all the joy of that salvation, is freely and particularly offered to you'; and you are peremptorily commanded to accept him, and to place your trust ia him ^. And are you still unwilling to trust in him ? The trut^ is, you ar6 in some degree, either willing to trust him, and his promises of salvation;. or willing to quit, henceforth^ all right to him, all interest in him^ and to for^o aH expectation fitnn him. Are you then willing, to bid an etemaladieu to the. only Saviour, and, in- testimony of your doing so, to transcribe arid sign this Declaration :-r-^ I, A. B. do hereby, in the presence of God the Judge of all, declare, that I henceforth renouncs^ and that for evef, all my part in the Saviour and in his salvation*; and that for tho fotnre, I will never allow myself to hope in- him, either for salvation or consolation ?' Now are you indeed willing, to subscribe this Renunciation ? If. you arc not: you bear false witness against yourself, when you say that you are not willing, to trust in Christ Jesus for salvation: for your are, either willing iu-

^ John ill. 16. and vi. 32. Rev. xxii. 17. " 1 John iii. 33»

•some degree to trust him, or willing to renounce him ^. Is your heart indeed willing, to be forever separate from the Lord Jesus ? Or is it matter of imliffi»^aice to you, whether He save you with an everhisting salvation, or punish you with everlast* ini^ destruction ? No: it cannot be.

^ I am aware, that even an cmnegeoerate man will refuse, in a deliberate and formal manner, to renoonce for ever, his claim to the Saviour ^ and yet continoe far from being willing, truly to heHeve^n him for all his salvation. But there is a great difference between th« refusal of t|ie careless dinner, so to renounce Christ, and that of the dlbconsolate saint. The reason why the secure sinner, ^vill refuse to abandon for ever, his claim to the only Saviour, is merely his fear of eternal torment; .whereas, .the reason why the disquieted saint, will tremble at the ^thought of renouncing hjs part in him, is not so much, his dread of eternal torment, as, of being for ever separat->^d from the blessed God, and for ever deprived of holy conformity to Him. The unwillingness of the disconsolate Christian, to renounce for ever, his part in the great Redeemer, arises from a principle of grace in his heart ^ and it implies a proportional degree of willingness to trust in Him, for all the parts of his salvation ^ though the Christian be not ahle, under trouble of mind, to discern this willingness in himself. As to the un-regenerate sinner, he may, indeed, be willing to trust in •the Lord Jesus, for preservation from hell ^ but he caa-not, 80 long as he continues unregenerate, be cordially •'^vtiling to rely upon him, for salvation from all sin : and ^therefore let him not flatter himself, that he is, in the 'ig^iallest degree, willing to exercise true faith.

. -i

peace iv believing '•" Committing himself, with all his spiritual and temporal concerns, to Christ Jesus, and trusting that Jesus will save him, and i^phold him, and manage for him ; his soul is, in proportion to the strength of his faith, set at ease. ^< He rests in the Lord, and waits patiently for him ^ ;" not only because it is his duty, but because it is the instituted mean of his attaining an increase of consolation. Knowing that, it is the Joy of the Lord, that is his strength for the ^iritual performance of every duty; he studies to increase in Ae lively exercise of faith, in order that ** believing, he may rejoice with joy unspeakable, and foil of glory ^." Indeed, faith is the principal mean, not only of recovering, but of increasing, holy consolation. The way to console is to settle the heart. Tlie increase of comfort, therefore, will be. according to the increase of faith. If the believer would advance in pure ccmsolation, let him endeavour diligently, and constantly, to exercise fidtb: let him " labour to enter into that rest*^/* To bring his heart, to the habitual exercise of trusting simply in the Saviour, will indeed cost him nuiny hard struggles, and hot conflicts with his remain* ing unbelief: but still he must labour, not only to exercise, but to increase his faith; and that, by acting faith more frequently, and by trusting in Christ at all times, for an increase of it He must endeavour, so to advance in the daily exercise of cordial, and direct confidence in Jesus ibr salvation, as thereby to receive from him, a daily iu-

ci'ease of holiness: far the more of holiness, he re-eeives, the more of holy codifort, he will experience. Let him also renew fi^^quently, his applica-lioh of the blood of Jesus to his conscience, for purging away the guilt which he is daily contract*-tng. The Apostle Paul informs us that, ^* The Jdngdom of God is righteousness, and jieace, and joy in the Holy Ghost*.'* From the spotless ^i^teousness of Jesiis -Christ, s^plied by faith, coineth peace, peace of conscience, as well as peace with God, and from peace, issueth joy. Hence it is evident, that the way to advance in spiritual •pence and joy, is to increase in that faith, which is •a relying on Christ and his righteousness, for justification tmd complete salvation. Moreover, the principal, if not tlie only way, in which, the Holy •Comforter administers consolation to believers, is, hy testifying of CInist to them. It is, by shewing them his loveliness and love, his ability and willingness to save, his suitableness and faithfulness^ and, by enabling them, so to confide in him for salvation to themselves, as to rejoice in the hope of that salvation. It is likewise, by enabling them to appropriate God in Clirist, and to place increasing confidence in Him. lliis was David's exercise, in order to attain more comfort: " I trusted in thee, O X.ord ; I said, Tliou art mi/ God." And the happy coflsequence of it, he expresses thus: " Blessed be the Lord ; for he hath she^^-ed me, his marvellous kindness in a strong city ^"

If the believer wojild attain increasing consola-s tion, he must likewise be more resolute ajtd express^

in his actings of faith. It wOl be necessary for him to be resolute, in looking away irom every other object of dependance, to Jesus. He must habitually and peremptorily resolve, to trust simply in Him ; and, in full assurance of fiuth, to intrust all his salvation, and all his concerns, to Hb care. * By thus casting bis burden upon the Lord Jesus, and trusting that He will make all thingii work together for good to him; his heart will be* come light and cheetful: he shall be freed from s thousand anxieties, which otherwise would disquiet and distract his soul, llie.more distinct and explicit, the actings of his faith are; the more peace, will they bring into his conscience, and the more joy, into his heart. When his actings of faith, are so lively and express, that he becomes habitually eovscious of them j he thereby, sits down to a rich feast of inward tranquillity, and even of spiritual delight. When his faith, under the influences of the Holy Spirit, is so direct, und soptf-ticular in its exercise, as to meet Christ in the promise, heart to heart, and eye to eye; it is like a rod of Myrtle in the hand of the traveller, which, as some say, revives his spirits, and enables him to proceed, without feeling himself wearv. He thereby dwells in him, who is the Consolatios of Israel, the Fountain from which, all the streams of ineffable delight do flow. Let every believer, then, study diligently to be more distinct, particular, and express, in his exercise of faith. Let hira endeavour daily, to be more and more express, especially, in his trusting in Christ, for salvation from the love, power, and practice of every sin.

2. It will be oecesaaij that he trust frequently in Christ, not only for salvation in general, but for an increase ^ comfort in particiilar. Let him ooo-tinue, humbly aiul firmly to trust that, the Lord Jesus will not cmly save him, but ** comfort him on every side $" and that. He will not mer^y preserve and increase in his soul, the kabit of spiritual joy, but that, he will &vour him in every time of need, with an increase even of sensible comfort.

Instead of refusing to be comforted, by raising captious and frivolous objections, against the consolation which in the gospel, is offered and promised him ; be should, upon the warrant of the gospel-offer, habitually desire, and constantly rely upon Christ for, a higher degree of it, according to the promise. He ought never to forget, that the comfort of the Holy Spirit, is one

C16 THE MEANS OF~INCREASnNG

of the fruits of trusting in the Lord ^. It is a part of the office of faith, to accept, and to hand, spiritual comfort to the holy soul. If faith therefore be strong, and frequently in exercise, such a soul will have strong consolation. If faith increase, in its habit, and in the frequency of its exercise, holy comfort will in proportion increase. Let the believer therefore trust at all times, in the Lord Jesus, for increasing consolation. Let him see that he take comfort, rather from Christ discovered, than from his own discoveries of him ; and that lie live comfortably, upon Ghris^t himsielf, rather tban upon his own experience of Christ. He should encourage himself continually, in his God and Saviour. Amidst all his inward and outward troiH blcs, he must, by the frequent actings of particular trust, derive strong consolation, from the'life, ihc death, the resurrection, the intercession, the cover nant, the words, the offices, the victories, and the relations, of Jesus Christ. He mikst also trust that, the blessed Spirit lovetli him ; .and that, as his gracious Comforter, ** He will abide with him for ever, and will bring all things to his reHacm-brance," that are necessary to comfort him'.

Believer, if thou wouldst advance in true conso' lation, thou must always trust that, whenever the Lord Jesus shall take from thee, any of thy present comforts; it will be, only to make .room for better and sweeter comforts. Intrust all thy temporal comforts, without the least anxiety, to thy iaithful Redeemer, and He will render them doub-Jy sweet to thee j or if he shall take any of them

•^.Pi'ov. xvi. 20. ' Jo!iB XIV. 26.

from thee, he will restore them again with much advantage, either in kind, or in Yalue. Beware of relying, partly on Christ, and partly, on the creature, for thy comfort. Derive all thy comforts of every kind, by the direct actings of faith, from Christ in the promise, and derive them onli/ from^ Him. It is the character of the true circumcision, that " they rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh™," *< If the sufferings of Christ," or sufferings in conformity to him, shall at any time, abound in thee, thy *^ consolation also win abound by Christ"." Look therefore to Je-ftusj the glorious Sun of righteousness^ for the lighter consolation, and not ta thyself; and^charge it often upon thy soul, to rejoice m Him.. When thou us^t diligently, the appointed means of advancing in spiritual comfort, do not forget to trust' that,; he will abundantly bless them for that purpose:'S9" shall they prove means, to thy soul, of increasing in holy consolaticm.

3.. If the believer would retain his comfort, and rise to higher degrees of it, he must exercise cori" slanflj/i the hope of.eternal life. As hope is a mean of recovering^ so it is a mean of increasing, spiritual comfort. The rtiore, therefore, that a good man ** abounds in hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit;" the more shall he " rejoice^ in the hope of the glory of God **," Having " fled for refuge, to lay hold upon the hope set before him^" let him «* sliew the same diligence, to the full assurance of hope/' that many especially of the first Christians shewed; and then he shall, like them, " have-

stroDg^ consolation >*." If he hope continaally, &r the full and endless fruition of God, and of the Lamby in the heavenly world; he shall thereby, be weaned from undue attachment to the preset world, and so shall be preserved from being much affected, either by the smiles, or the frowns, of worldly men. If he exercise daily, *• the lively hope of that inheritance, which is incorruptible, tindefiled, and which fadeth not away, reserved ia heaven for him;" and build his hope upon the sure,, the immoveable, foundation laid in Zion, ranote from all the changes experienced in himself; be shall thereby, ^< hold fast the confidence, and the rejoicing of the hope, firm unto the end '*.'' Were the believer to exercise constantly, a lively and firm expectation of sufficient grace in time, and of consummate blessedness through eternity; it would be a special mean of exciting, and promoting, ifieffable delight in his soul: it would fill hk-heart, with overflowings of holy gratitude, and his lips, with expressions of joy and triumph. In proportion as his hope is grounded, and freqnendy exercised, on the love of God, on the- promise ef eternal life, and on the righteousness^ gi's^e, and faithfulness, of the glorious Redeemer; it brings more and more of eternal life, and of that heavenly delight which forms a part of it, into his soul. That living hope is from above, and in proportion as it is strengthened, and frequently exercised, it elevates the holy soul, to the things which are above. The believer, when he is exercising it, lives in a joyful ex-* pectation, and a sweet anticipation, of the inefiable

4. It will be requisite for the same purpose, tliat he daihj advance in love to the Lord Jesus, and to God iij him. The Chrisiim>'s love to Chr\^t, is the immwhate principle of hi& deh'ghtlng or joying m lihn, Ta advuiure therefore iu supreme love to Clirist, is llie way ta increase in holy joy. The apostle Paul^ in describing the fruit of the Spirit, mentions jay and pence, in immediate connection "(vith love ^. And the Lord Jesus, himsell^ ubeii he was comforting his disciples, said, *^ If a man love me, ho wilt keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto hun, and make our abode with him ^." Love is a pleasant, a cheering affection. Those belieirers, therefore, who excel otliers in love to Christ Jesus, do commonly suipass others also, in spiritual comfort. The exercise of supreme love to Him, and to God iii him, difTuscth a sacred sweetness over the soul. Whether it be a love of desire to him, when he is absent, or of delight in him, when he is present; still, in proportipj;! to the strength, and the excr-eise of it, it ;Sweetly r^resliea and envigorates the soul. '' There. is na fear in love/' :says the apo^' tie John; " but perfect love casteth out fear*.* Although it is always attended^ with a holy and filial fear of displeasing God; yet, in proportion to the degree and exercise of it in the soul, it banishes

holy consolation, does he experience. Believer, set that thou advance daily, in supreme and ardent affection, to God in Christ, to all of God, and all of Christ: love especially the holiness, the wiH, and the glory of Christ. Let thy soul cleave contift-ually to Him j and it will comfort thee greatly, to think of him,, and of his immense, and amazing love to thee. To advance in suprecne love to thy dear Redeemer, will, notwithstanding all the af-ilictions^ which may henceforth be&l thee in thy lot, render thee capable of increasing in heavenly consolation. Difficult things will for His sake, (seem easy, and bitter things, sweet..

5. If the believer would advance in holy conso* lation, let him, in the faith of redeeming love to him, learn to deligJu more and more^ in the ktw of the Lord. The more, he is ena.bled to delight in the '»iU of God, expressed in that holy law ; the more comfortable and happy is he, in doing that will * : the more pleasure, does he take, in performing every part of his duty: and seeing he is commanded to employ himself a/ura^^, in present duty; the more, his present duty is his delight, the more, will he always be delighted. ^^ Great peace,'' salth the Psalmist, ** have they who love thy law: and nothing shall oiBTend them V For the more, they delight in the holiness, spirituality, and perfection of the law, as the rule of their duty, and in holy obedience to it; the clearer evidence they have, that they are so justified by^aith, as to have peace with God; the more, do they enjoy peaoe of con-jscience^ which is a sense of peace with God ^ and

• Ps. cxik i. ^ Pt. cxix» 16S.

ih^ more, are they at peace with' the creatures of God. No external troubles or offencesy can deprive them of this ** great peace," or divert them from the path of dutj^, in which they delight; Indeed the more, a holy man delights in the commandments of the law, as expressions, of the will of • God the Father who loveth him, of the mind of Christ who redeeroeth him, and of the desire of the Holy Spirit who dwelteth in him; the more, will he regard sincere obedience to them^ as his privilege, his pleasure, and his- comfort. Those precepts, which are all " holy, and just, and good," prescribe good ^nd pleasant work to him; such ^ work as is, not only good for him, but agreeable ' to the bent of his renewed nature. Tlie more, . therefore, he advances in sanctification, the more pleasure, doth he take in doing, and even in suffer- -iug» the will of his heavenly,Father. So much, was this the attainment of the holy apostle Paul, . ttat " he gloried in tribulations;'', that '*he took -pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, ill persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake;" because it was tha will of God, that he should endure them, and because they aSoried the jpower of Christ, an opportunity so to rest upon him, as to ' be gloriously displayed, and evidenced to be per*^ feet, in his weakness^. Doubdess, his taking pleap-sure even in manifcdd sufferings, for the sake of -Christ, could not but be attended with such a mea-sure of holy consolation, as would make him ^* exceeding Joyful, in all his tribulation **.*' Thus it is < evident, that the more a believer delights in the -*

*^ 2 Cor. xii. 9, 10. ^ 2 Cor. vii. 4.-*-

O 6

providential, and especially in the preceptive, will c^God, and the more spiritual and exact his obedience is J the more experience has he, of spiritual comfort. Besides, his delighting in, or savouring those things of the Spiiit, is a comfortable evidence to him, not only,-that he hath the Spirit of Christ, and that the prevailing inclination • of his heart, is toward spiritual and holy objects; but, that the delight which he has rn the Lorcl, and in the word and law of the Lord^ is his chief ddight *. O how cheering must it be to n- holy nmiiy to be conscioi-S) not only that the grace of the promises, but that the holiness of the precepts, instead of displeasing him, renders them inexpressibly pleasant to his soul'! He cannot perish in his affliction, bts cause the law of God is his delight «^. Delight in the will of the Lord, is heaven upon efarth, the very essence of real satisfaction, of itm^ fyicit}*. The I^ord himself, is^^ inconceivably.liappy in his own will J and he hath rewaled it tohfs people, that they might be happy in it likewise*

6. Another mean of retaining and increasing spiritual comfort, is, frequently to exercise goity sofTOWyOr coniriiioti'ofhearfj for sin^: To^be oitt-trite in heart is, from a principle of fiiith in'Christ, of love to God, and of desire to please and honour him, to be sorrowful for having sinned against him. The apostle Paul styleth sorrow for sin, ** god^ sorrow ^ ," that is, sorrow which hath God in Christ, for its authm^ and its object; or sorrowybr God, for having by sin, offended a God of infinite

* Ps. xlili. 4. and cxix. 12T. ^ Ps. cxix. 143.

^ Fs, cxix. 92. ^ 2 Cor. vii. 10.

holiness, justice, faithfulness, and goodness; or sorrow according to God, according to beheving views of his redeeming mercy, and according to his holy will; or sorrow which is accepiable to God, through Jesus Chri$t. The same apostle in-forms us that, " it worketh repentance wnto salvation/' that evangelical repentance, which is a man*s turning from all sin to God, as in Christ a God of infinite mercy and grace. Now in order to advance in holy consolation, the Christian must, in the faith of pardoning mercy, and. of sanctifying grace^ exercise frequently that godly sorrow for sin, especially for tl:o sin that dwelloth in him. The exercise of godly sorrow, is not only consistent with holy joy 5 but it always tends to it, and frequently issues in it; yea, it even includes \X, Such refr^sliing of soul, such joy of heart, is often experienced in the depth of godly sorrow 5 that the true penitent would not exchange, even the lowest degree of that joy, for all the carnal mirth in the world. . The most sorrowful Christian would not, for a thousand worlds, exchange states, or pleasures, with the most prosperous of ungodly men« In eomparison ^f that pure and solid joy, with which, the penitential sorrow of a true belier^r, is often attended, caraal mirtli is folly, and even madne^L His mourning for sin, because it hath offended his gi*acious God, and wounded his compassionate Saviour; because it hath pierced that heart which loveth him, and shed, that blood which saveth him; is a joyful mourning, a real comfort to his souL To mourn for sin,

' £c?les. ii. 2.

on such accounts as these, Is| as one expresses it^. to weep for joy. As godly sorrow cannot be exercised^ by the Christian, without some comfortable apprehension of.the mercy of God to him, or of Christ's having been pierced for ^is iniquities j so, it is seldom exercised by him, without some do gr-oa of comfort ej^perienced, cither in, or after, his exercise of it. " Wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace^.'* The believing penitent takes delight^ in mourning for his crucified Redeemer; in sitting down at his pierced feet, and bathing tliem with his tears. His godly, sorrow is a mean, both of preparing him . for consolation, ^nd of introducing it into liis soul. Accordingly, Jehovali promiseth that He will ** dwd\ with him, who is of a contrite and humble spirit,, to revive the spirit of tlie humble, and- to revive the heart of tlie contrite ones *.** The Lord Jesus also saith, ^^ IMessed are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted "*:" and again, ** The Lord hath anointed iDe,»..to bind up. the broken-hearted ;.«.to comfort all that mourn °." Hence holy fasting is represented in Scripture, as spiritual^ feasting ^. The penitential grief of a holy man, is also matter of joy to him. He rejoices more, to feel his heart melting for sin, than he would do, in enjoying all the carnal delights of the sons of men. He finds a secret sweetness in the tears of evangelical repentance j a balm which refreshes and cheers his soul. Besides, godly sorrow renders him capable of receiving in a higher degree, in^

* Prov. Ill 17. f Isa. Ivii. 15. » Malth. v. 4» " Imu Ixi, 1, 2. • Zcch. viii. 19.

. IN SPIRITUAL COMFORT. S27

floences of holy consolation. The more he grieves-in a godly manner for sin, the more capable is he, of rejoicing in God his Saviour: yea, the more he grieves that he cannot as he ought, grieve for his iniquity, and mourns that he cannot mourn; the more capacity has he, for receiving and enjoying spiritual comfort The foy of God's salvation is not to be found, but in die deep recesses of a contrite heart. Although, then, true repentance consists more, in turning from all sin to God, than merely in sorrow for sin j yet, in order to retain and Increase his comfort, for the service and the glory of God, the believer should diligently exercise that sorrow.

7. It will be necessary for the same purpose, that he be more and more diligent in mortifying the sin, that dwelleth in him. When the Christian finds himself, yielding to motions of s|n in his heart, it cannot but occasion to him, trouble of soul; but, when he feels himself, by the sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit, enabled to resist or act against them, it is a special comfort, to him: and the more he is enabled to maintain a holy opposition to them, the more pure and solid, is hi» consolation. To mortify the deeds of the body of sin, and the members of it which are upon the earth p, is,—constantly to apply the blood and the Spirit of Christ, for subduing, weakening, and destroying it, with all its corrupt affections, principles, and practices: it is, by the gracious infla-encesofthe Spirit of Christ, so to resist, and to subdue, the vital qualities, and active powers of

the botly of sin in ihe heart, as gradually tb des^ troy them. Now, one of the means^ which the believer must employ, in order to retain and increase his comfort, is, to maintain constantly, a holy opposition to all the affections, principles, and motions, of the body of sin in him ; until, in conformity to Christ in his crucifixion, and by grxrcc derived from his fulness, they be destroyed. The more resolute he is, and. the more pleasure, be takes, in thus mortifying them; the more of spiritual and pure consolalion, will he attain. The more of sanctilying influences, he derive^ by faidi, for the mortification of sin ; the more of consoling influences, will l:e commonly receive. Accordingly, David prayed thus, *' Create in me a cleau heart, O God ; renew in mfe a right spirit;" apd-then, ** Restore to me thejc?^ of thy salyalioB %" As the Christ inn advances, in mortifying hi^ unbelief and pride, his self-righteous and ^vp^ldly spirit 5 he will increase his enjoyment of the cliee;dng. light of his heavenly Father's countenance. The more diligent and successfid he is, in mortifying his propensity to cavil or dispute, against the free-ness of the offers, promises, and grace of the gospel ; the more disposed he will be, to admit, and to relish, the comfoits of the gospel. It is in proportion as remaining sin dies in the believer, that he lives a life of holiness, and of comfort. The weaker the body of sin in him, is, the less power over him, will his other spiritual enemies have: the temptations of Satan, and of the world, will proportionably lose their influence with him. The

•

only care of the hypocrite, is, to reform his life ; whereas, the main, though not the only, concern of the sincere believer, is, to cleanse his kear£ % And the sweetness, which he experiences, in obtaining victory over sin in his heart, is a thousand times greater, than the seeming pleasure, which is felt in grati^'ing sin. Indeed, were the least real pleasure to be enjoyed in sinning^ the torments of the damned in hell, would thereby be grealtly lessened ; for there, they will for ever sin, in the utmost degree possible: but, instead of being the less, they sliall be the more tormented ^, as well as for, their sirniing. Believer, take heed that thou be dilijgent, in mortifying the depi'avity of thy heart. The further thou advancest, in mortifying the sin that remains in thee; and especially the sin that more easily besets thee; the more pleasure wilt thou tekcy in mortifying it, and the more comfort wik thou experience, in thy conflicts with it. Learn to hate all sin, in an ifii^reasihg degree; for the mor^^ thou abhorrest it, the greater delight thou wilt take, in opposing, and subduing it. Holy joy can consist with remaining sin, but not with retained abd indulged sin. Mortify then, through the Spirit j the corruption of thy nature; and Christ will not be constrained to mortify it for thee, by the extremity of outward, or of inward trouble. Study to attain more eminence in that grace, which is the direct opposite of the sin, which doth easily beset thee.

S30 . THE MEANS OF INCREASING

8. The Christian must, for the same enJ, endeavour daily, to become more and more circumspect and conscienthttSy in the practice of universal holi-^ ness. It is only, in proportion as he ** walketh in-the fear of the Lord," that he can walk ** in the t5omfort of the Holy Spirit •." To walk circumspectly is, to be habitually cautious and watchful^ on every side, against all manner of sin; and to be always attentive to every duty, and %q ey&tj cir-^ cumstance of duty: or it is, to walk in all tbe duties of holiness, with wisdom, diligence, and ex* actness. So far as a good man walketh circum-spectXjy he is in all things,upri^t, exacts andccm* scientious. He is ^< in the fear of the Lord all the-day long ^" From a princijde of faith in Christy and of love to God, he dreads sin as the worst evil in the world; and consequently, he abstains evoft* from all appearance of that evil^. He abstains from the very appearance of k, not mesely, be^ cause he sees that it is reasonable and prudent to do so, but because it is the will of his God and. Father. And though this doth not afford him, the smallest title to Divine consolation; yet lie kndws that it is a necessary mean of it, and that it is inseparably connected with as much of it, as the Lord seeth good ta afford him. The more spiritually, and closely, he walks with God; the more, doth he walk in the light of his countenance^ The more, he makes the practice of universal holiness, his main business, a business in which, be principally engages, and which, he pursues with the greatest earnestness and diligence; the clearer evir >

Let the believer then beware of sinning, especially, of sinning wilfully : for that would provoke the Lord, to cover his evi« dences with a cloud in his anger, and to suspend influences of consolation, from his souL Let it be his constant purpose, and unwearied endeavour^ through grace, to please God in every thing, and to. displease Him in nothing. To walk circumspect* ly, is indeed the sure way to walk comfortably,, and to advance in comfort. He who is enabled^ from the principles of &ith and love, and for the glory of God, so to walk, ^^ shall sing in the righteous ways of the Lord *;" for he shall find that they ^^ are ways of pleasantness, and paths of peace.'' Aa holy comfort, is neces&arv to the practice of holiness I so increasing holiness of heart and of life, is. requisite to the maintenance and increase of com--fort. As heat accompanies fire, so a greater or lesa measure of comfort, usually attends, the spiritual performance of holy actions ^^ It cannot be otherwise. For to walk circumspectly in a course of holy obedience, is, to walk with God, the God o£ all comfort $ t9 walk in Christ, the Consolation oB Israel; and to walk after the Spirit, the Holy Comforter.

If the believer would walk so circumspectly, as to glorify Christ, and to promote his own comfort,

* John xiv. 15,16. ' Fs. cxxxViii. 5. ' Fs.xix. 11*.

he must, first, tflke heed that he do not on any occasion, walk ill the darky that he do not go forward, where he cannot, by the light of holy Scripture, discern his way ; and, next, he should be as much a&aid of taking comfort, merely from his duties themselves, us from his sins,

9. To grow in spiritual mindcclness, is also die way to maintain and increase' spiritual comfort •* To be spiritually minded" is, from the spiritual principles of grace, and under the sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit, to have the mind and heart, frequently, intently, and delightfully, era-ployed about spiritual objects. It is, to have all the powers of the soul habitually concurring, ia spiritual thoughts and desires, and in taking a holy complacence in the things of the Spirit, especially in the things concerning Christ, "and the wmider-ful scheme of redemption by him^ Now, one special mean of advancing in spiritual consolation, is, to increase in spiritu^ mindedness.- The apostle Paul informs us that, " to be spiritually mind--ed is life and peace*." It is in its very nature, spiritual life^ and is the earnest.and the beginning of life eternal, consisting in the full and itnmediate fruition of God and the Lamb, in the mansions of glory: and, in proportion as the believer increases in it, his soul is endued, not only with spiritual activity, but with pleasing serenity, and pure consolation. Tlie more spiritually minded, he become?^ the more of spiritual/;^flr<? and comfort, he attains. The more, he spiritually understands, metlitates, relishes, and delights in, the doctrine of redeeming grace, and tlie glory of God, displayed in the won-

* Rom. V\Vv, ^,

dcrful person and work of the great Redeemer; tlie more of pleasing tranquillity, and of refreshing delight, does he experience. By how much, he grows in spiritual understanding, or, in the knowledge of the transcendent loveliness and love of God in Christ, and of the excellence, suitableness, and freeness, of salvation by Christ j by so much, does he experience holy serenity, and solid consolation, in committing to such a God, and such a Saviour, all his spiritual and tenqioral concerns. ^ In proportion. as his heart becomes more deeply sensible, of the unparalleled holiness and beauty of spiritual objects, and of his own personal interest ki them j it is delighted, enlarged, and- elevated. Whether4ie contemplates the cheering truths, and precious promises of the gospel, or practises the spiritual duties of the law, towa,rd his God or his nc^hbour^ tl>e inor« spiritual he is, in them, the more pure^ «6'lid,'^Jid heavenly, is the pleasure which li6 enjoyi^i l^hese are the banquet of his mind. They are sweeter than honey to his taste. In proportion ais Ms' *spirituaj iinderstanding, and bis disposition to coflnt all earthly things, empty and mearij in comparison of union with Christ and -4>f <x)Dformity to Him, increase j he sets his affection on things above, he places his happiness in them, and rejoices in hope of them. When he advances in habitual desires, and in holy endeavours, to aim, in all his exercise of graces, and performance of duties, at the glory of his God and Redeemer; he, in the same proportion, glories and delights in the Loird. To become more and more spiritually minded, then, is a sure way of attaining higher degrees of spiritual comfort. As d\<il\\5^\^\:

a bird ilies, the more out of danger he is, from the snares of the fowler; so the higher a believer soars, in spirituality of mind, above the virorkl, the higher, and the safer, is his consolation. ~ Moreover, the Christian, in order to attain increasing comfort, must be always on his guard a» gainst formality and remissness^ in his exercise of graces, and performance of duties. To be remiss or formal, in performing any of his duties, is th^ very opposite of being spiritually minded. Now he may assure himself, that he is declining into formality,—if he be more studious of approving himself to men, than to God ; if, instead of performing his duties, with hoi}' delight, he perform them as a task 5 if, instead of habitually exercising faith, love, godly sorrow, and spiritual desire, in performing them, he satisfy himself with the external performance; and, if the remaining carnality of his mind, be not so grievous or burdensome to him, as formerly. Nothing will more effectually hinder, his advancing in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, than remissness or negligence of spirit, in the duties of religion *. For, when the Christian does not serve God with his spirit, he grieves the Holy Spirit of God, and provokes Him to suspend influences of consolation, from his soul; and when he does not ardently pursue increasing comniunion with Christ, in holy exercises, he cannot expect, to enjoy the comfm-t of communion with him.

10. Another mean of a believer's advancing in «pirit«al comfort, is, to become more and more con^

* Songv. % 6^ Prov^ X. 4.

Heni mth God in Christy as his inheritance. He cannot be comfortable, but in proportion as he is content. God in Christ, as their Covenant-God, is the sure, the boundless, the unchanging, and the everlasting, portion of all the saints. Nothing can he added to Him: nothing can be taken from him, ^r diminished in him. A holy man may lose all his earthly possessions, but he cannot lose bis God, nor any thing in God; and therefore he •continues still as rich, as he was before. His out--ward comforts, are only lent him, in order to be *4ased for a season, and then, to be willingly and 'thankfully restored; but his God, is given him, to •be eternally enjoyed by him, as his immense, unchangeable, and sure portion: and therefore he has as muth reason, to be satisfied with, and to xejoice in, his all-sufficient inheritance, after, as before, his outward losses. The ancient Church, accordingly, after she liad been deprived of her best external comforts, placed her happiness and her hope in Jehovah, as her sure portion: ^* The Lord js tny portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him ^." And Asaph^ when he was emerging from iiis depths of spiritual trouble, said to Jehovah, ** Whom have I in heaven but thee ? and there is none upon earth, that I desire besides thee. My flesh and my heart faileth; but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever ^.'' The sincere believer, trusting that a gracious God be-stoweth Himself, and all that he is, and that he liath, upon him, as his infinite inheritance; should be much more content than he is, with his por-

* Lam. ill. 24. *^ Ps.Ixxiii. 25, 26.

tion. Tlie more satisfied he is with God in Christy tis his inheritance, the more pleasure will he take in him; and the more pleasure lie taketh in him, the more consolation will he receive from him, wai the more will he rejoice in him. ** Although the fi<r-ti*ee shall not blossom," saith Habakkuk. ** nei-ther shall fruit be in the vines ;...yet will I rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation **." In prc^rtion as the believer is content with God, or satisfied that his Covenant-God is enough for Irim, without any thing else^ except what infinite wisdom and love see meet, for a time, to afford hrni; he attains true, lasting, and increasing enjoyment. If he have outward comforts, he enjoys God in them; or if he have bcea* xleprived of tlicm, he still enjoys them in God: s© that, his spiritual eiijoymcnt or comfort is not, fitrictly speaking, depcndeiit on them. Being satis* fied with God himself, as his portion, he learns to be content with all the providential dispensations of.God. " I have learned,''' says Paul, ** in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content^," &c. The Lord Jesus hafth given to his Church, >* exceeding great and-precious promises;" in order that every saint may, by faith, " suck, and be satisfied With, these breasts of her tronsolation*^:'* and-God, having reconciled them to himself in him, hath graciously promised that. He mil be t/ieir God, O what cause, then, hath the believer, to be always content! " He is an heir of God, and a joint heir with Christ ;'* and therefore— aU

11. If the believer would advance in spiritoal » consolation, he must also increase daily, in My re^ signation to the will of the Lord. He must endea* vour, by grace, not only to be content with God in Christ, as his infinite portion ; but to increase ■ in holy resignation of heart, to the will of God, with respect to all his earthly comforts. The way to advance in peaceful* tranquillity of soul, is, to become so resigned to the providential will of the Lord, as always to submit without murmuring, to that holy will. God's will of providence, as well as his will of precept, is'^ not only wise, and sovereign, but holy, and just, and good. It is infinitely 'wise9 and therefore it cannot be lialde to the smallest mistake, in its detern^ination of any thii^, re« q)ecting the external condition of the believer. It is absolutely sovereign^ and therefore it is invain fi» him, to attempt resistance to it. >!(; is also infinitely holy and righteous; and for these reasons, it is infinitely incapable of doing a Christian, the smallest iujury, or of dispensing to him any thing, whether pleasant or painful, but what is right, and i even necessary for him. It is infinitdy good ]j3s»'

(rise; and thcnrefore it can appoint nothing to hap-3en in the putward condition of a believer but pi^hat is good, yea, best^ for subserving at the time^ 'he sanctification and consolation of his sbnl. So TQod, is the will of the Lord^ that it hath deter-nined, never to give, nor to take away, a single mtward comfort from a saint, but when this is rood for jiim, or even necessary, to pron)ote the rreat designs of redeeming grace, in bis salvation* $o wise and good, is that adorable will, that all hings do, under the direction and control of it, * work together for good, to them who love God, o them who are the called according to his pur-rose *.'* If therefore, a holy man would advance n pure consolation, he must study, in dependance >n the grace of Christ, cordially to resign himself, md all his concerns, to the holy will, of h,is hea-""enly Father. The more, he studies to delight in he holy will of God, the more, will he be disposed o acquiesce in it; and the more he acquiesces n it, the more of comfort, amidst all the vicisi* odes of life, shall he experience. Let him endea^^ *our to love it, in an increasing degree: for, in proportion as he loves it, he will be pleased with t, and will rejoice to think that, every thing iu r!s lot has been, from eternity, unalterably fixed 4»;ording to it. 'He will delight in the cheering bought that, under the direction and control of t, all objects, all events, do either directly or in* lirectly, promote his eternal welfare; and that, all rands in the universe, are contimially at work^ for pod to him. If affliction come, Jthe storm, which

* Bom. viil. 28. P2

*t)40 THE MEANS OF INCREASIKa

tlien arises in his natural passions, is hushed into a calm ; and not only doth submission, but sweet resignation, ensue.

So far as the believer attains holy resignatioDi he is secure from disappointment; for his leading de* sire, that the will of the Lord may be done con-x^erning him, cannot fail to be accomplished. He believes that, the Lord chooseth better for him, than he can do, for himself. He is persuaded, not only that he hath no rights to complain of any providential dispensation, but thnt he hath no teason; because " all the paths of the Lord, are mercy and trutli to him *." ** I was dumb," says holy David, ** I opened not my mouth, because thoii didst it V In proportion as he is resigned to the holy will of God, he is always pleased, always comfortable; because whatever pleaseth God, pleases him. As far as his will is in union with the will of the Lord, he shall always have what he chooses: he shall constantly be in a state of enjoyment, as having the y^ry thing which he desires. If he be under affliction, Jhe comforts himself with thinking that, it is the appointment of his heavenly Father's wili Believer, the more thou w^comest the whole will of thy gracious God and Father, .the Hiore happi^ ness and comfort, shalt thou enjoy. Consider, hov unbecoming, how sihful it is, to murmur against the will of the only-wise God thy Saviour. Know that, >tl)e momei^t thou repinest at the providence of the Lord, thou se(;retly accusest him : thou pre-sumest to charge Him, with having done thee as injury; to blanie him for something wrong, in his

O, if thou ipvouldst maintain spiritual consolation, take heed ihat, thoU-niuinnur not against the holy will of thy gracious God; Thou art not qualified, to be the chooser of thy ownoutwaid condition $ and there-fojpe it belongeth not to thy wisdom and will^. bu^ to His, to dispose of all thy affairs;

12. Another mean of advancing iti^Holy coii^o-^ lationv is, to become more and mure thankful for hies--jiug^s,'. either received J or promised; "To give thanks always for all things, unto God and the Father, in the name of our Lord Jesus Ghri^ ",'* jbboth the duty, and'the privilege, of a-holy man; It is his dutyj in every condition of life, to maintain a thankful frame of hearty and to express daily to the Lord, a lively and grateful sense of the unmerited, and unnumbeilsd benefib, whith He hatli bestowed upon him. The apostle Paul, ac« cordingly, gave this charge to the Thessalonians; ^ In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Ghrist Jesus, concerning you ^.'^ And, in his Epistle to the Hebrews, he says, " By^ him, therefore, let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name **." It is also bl privilege to the believer, when he is enabled in every circumstance of life, to be thankful for the mercies, which God bestoweth either upon himself or others. A disposition to be, in every condition, tliankful to the Lord, for benefits received from him, is always attended with some degree of comfort,, in st

holy soul; A saint's frequent recpllection, and ac-knowleiTgment, of. the sweet merci^ which he ha& in handy and of the sure mercies - which he has in hope^ tend to sweeten and to cheer his spirit Praise and thanksgivings ac^rding (o the foUow-ing passages of Scripture, are the genuine expressions of a comfortable frame of soul: *^ My heart greatly rejoiceth, and with my song will 1 praise him ^Z' ^* Because thy loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee." ** My mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips^*' " My lips sball greatly rejoice, when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed*." While these passages evince praise and thanksgiving, to l>e the native expressions of holy joy ; they at tho same time, intimate that a sainCs being disposed} gratefully to praise and thank the Lord, for bl^ ^ings, either received or promised, is commoal; attended with an increase of comfort or joy. Aa habitual cheerfulness of spirit, is thereby maintain-odand increased. A )ieart truly thankful is, in the same proportion, cheerful. The most humble and tliankful of the saints, ai*e commonly the most ciminent in holiness and comfort. Indeed, thank* fuhlei^s and comfort imply each other. A holy man ipust be in some degree, comfortable, in order to be thankful ; and thankful, in order to be in an increasing degree, comfortable. If, then, he would retain and. increase his holy consolation, let him frequently give thanks to God, not only for ths unspeakable gift of his dear Son ; but, for all his benefits conferred upon him : let bi^i, aa often and

♦ P{^. xsvlii, 1, ' Ps» Ixlii. 3, 5. « Ps. Ixxi. 23»

as much as possible, gratefully remember them, and ** thank the Lord for each of them; whether it be a ' great or a smaU, a spiritual or a temporal, bles-^-sing. He must be thankful particularly, for the degree of comfort with which, the Lord hath already favoured him ; and then, if his trials or suf« ferings do at any time abound, '* his consolation by Christ will also abound ^" Let him extract arguments, even from the darkest dispensations of providence, for exciting him to be al'voays thank« fill to his God and Redeemer: for, when he is oontinually thankful, he will in the same proiX)r-tion, be comfortable* He should, moreover, ex* press his gratitude daily, for the inestimable and innumerable blessings, vouchsafed to him ^ by giving to God in Christ,-all the glory of thera, and by Employing them all, for the purposes of his glory: so shall he enjoy them, and experience increasing comlbrt in using them.

If). Further, Let the believer j:?ray'with increasing importunity,^/br tkeconlinuance and increase al " his holy comlbrt. The fervent and incessant prayer of faith, is a mean, not only of recovering, but of retaining, and increasing, spiritual consolation. Let him therefoi*e pray iinportunately, not only for sanctifying, hut.for consoling influences. The Spirit is the Comforter of the saints; .and God . **' giveth the. Holy Spirit, to them who ask him *».'* The Christian, then, should with increasing earnestness, pray to his heavenly Father, ia the name of Christ, and in the faith of the promise, for the • refreshing and comforting gra.ce of the blessed ^

' 2X)or. i. 5. «Lukexi. 13.

Pi

Spirit. The more earnestly and frequently, he offers up the prayer of faith, for grace and coni-solation; the more will his heart be strengthened, with the consolation of the Holy Comfovter. ** In the day when I cried-," saith David, ** thou^an-sweredst me, and strengl^enedst me with strength, in my soul ^.*' When the God o£ eonsoIadoD, seeroeth at any time, to be forgetting, or passing by the exercised believer; the prayer of faith will call him in. When the Lord Jesus, having comt to Emmaus, made as though he would have gcrne further^ and when the two disciples eonstraio-ed him, saying, *^ Abide with u&; for it is towards evening, and the day is far spent; He went in to tarry with them *." TTie less, true Christians desire from Christ,., the less, do they glorify the immense riches of his grace; but, on the contraiyi the more they expect, and the more they ask from him, the more will he give, and the more will he manifest his delight, in giving to them. The believer therefore should pray, as the apostle Paid did for the saints at Rome, " That the God of hope, would fill him with all joy and peace in believing y ;•' and, as the same apostle prayed for the Thessalonians, " That the Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God even his Father, would contfort hb heart, and establish him in every good word and work *." And he should pray as the disciples did, That the Lord would increase his feith; for as faith is increased, so is the joy of faiths* Let him

^ Ps. cxxxviii. 3. *Xuke xxiy. 28, 29.

^ Kqoi. XV. 13, *^ 2 Thess, ii. 16,. 17.

pray that he may be enabled, always to thirst for spiritual consolation, <* as the hart tbirsteth for the water-brooks;'' and, at the same time, let his desire of sensible comfort, be regulated by a due submission to the sovereign will of God. Paul had' not been long praying, before it was revealed to him, that he was a chosen vessel. It was, when^ Jesus Christ himself was praying, that He was transfigured, and that ^^ a voice from the excellent; glory, said. This is my beloved So% in whom I am well pleased." Those of the.saints who pray most, have the most comfort* Prayer crowneth God, with the glory of his redeeming grace; and God erowneth prayer, with the comlbrt of thai grace.

If a holy man would so pray, as thereby to advance in spiritual comfort, he must not only pray in ^th, and with importunity j^ but he must pray with hi.s spirit,, with understanding, with sincere desire of that which he asketh^ with watchfulness, Mtention, and ardour. He should make supplication to God, as his God^aBd Father, in the name of Christ, by the help of the Spirit, and only for things which are promised. '^ S^e ought always to pray, and. hot tp fi|int^ ;'^ or, << to continue instant in* prayer ^'' It will- be secessary alsp, that he plead in. praver; that he pleaid the promises, and that he fill nfs raoulh with such argument^, as will tend, to.excite and iiiicrease his faith, and hpp6, and Iove»' He must, moreover, be habitually disposed to pray, to interniingle ejaeulatory prayer with all his othet dudes, and to pray much in secret, ft was whenu Jacob retired for secret prayer, that the Atig^l ofi

the covenant came to hia], and enabled him so to wrestle with Him by supplication, as to receive the blessing. She, who was alone with Jesus at the sepulchre, was the first, who participated in the joy of* his resurrection. The holy Psalmist, seems to have considered the comfort, which he enjoyed with God in secret^ as his sweetest comfort S

14. It is necessary for the same purpose, that the believer mcrease daily, in his knowledge qf Hm grounds of spiritual consolation. JHe must, in pr-der to advance in true comfort, study through grace, to attain clearer and juster views of God the Father, as a God of love, gface, and mercy to him; of Christ, in his person^ righteousness, ful-iiess, offices, and ^ relations; of.'the? Holy Spirit, as his quickener, sanctifies, Comferter, anbd guide; of the covenant of grace, in the aAnfrablo snit-t sibleness, fulness, and stability of itf and of the doctrines, offers, and pr(»nises of the glorious gospel. The more spiritual and enlarged, cleaf and distinct, his knowledge, especiaUy, of these grounds of pure consolation, is; the more^ wi^ he see reason to be of good comibrt; the xiKixe^will the principle and habit of spiritual joy, increase in his soul; and the moi*e, will he rejoice in Christ Jesus, and glory in bis cross* A^ spiritual and clear understanding of tliose^rious, and reviving objects, win make his way dear, in /^(iEfiig comfort Remaining ignorance^ in the' mjnd of a good man, IB, for the most part^ the parent gf all hia doubts lind perplexities of spirit; because he doQs not knowi how iar he may» of may ^aot, take entcour^

15. If the believer would attain an increase ef spiritual, and solid confsolatiofiy let him not give ear to the reports^ of sense. By sense here, ie meant, the present frames or feeling, or pereeption, of an exercised Christian; which is either pleasant, or unpleasant, and is contimiaily sfibjeet to ebange; To hearken and trust to the reports of sense, or in other words, to' make his feelings or frames, •the ground of his faith, or the rule according to which, he regulates his exercise; renders the feith of the Christian, unsteady, and hinders the growth of it: and if the growth of faith, be obstructed^ the increase of spiiitu;^! comfort, will be obstructed likewise} Sense judges- and reports, that he is in a state of grace, and that Christ saveth him, liierely, because his feelings are pfeasant and com-fortable^ It concludes that his state is either good or bad, only from what hejeelsj or from his present frame of spirit. If this be lively and pleasant, ^ensc repoits that he is in a state of grace, and that Christ is acting the part of a Saviour to him* If,' on the contrary, his frame be dull and unf^eas* ant, sense reports that he is iiot in a state of grace, and that it wouki be rash' and presumptuous in Aimi to trust that Jesus will save him. Thus the report, which it makes to the believer^s conscience, of the $tato of his soul before God, and of his sal* vation by Jesus Christ, is not founded on unchangeable grounds, which would set bis mind'and conscience at rest; but, on things which are changeablef and which frequentfy expose^ him to perplexing doubts and fears. If,, instead of md[-ing the record of God, he make his lively feelings^ the jS>iuidbtioaof 1^^V\ \ \\\ftactin(^effittth,wlK

be either lively or languid, either more or Iess», just as these are. If, instead of trusting in Christy upon the warrant of the offers and calls of the gospel, which is an unchanging, as well as an au* thentic, warrant, he trust in Christ, upon the ground of his own pleasant teelitigs, which are perpetually clianging; hh exercise of faith must cease, as often as his lively or comfortable frame ceases* Now,, how can his faith increase, if it be not dafft/ exercised ^ and how can be exercise it daily, if he think that he ought not to exercise ity but upon the ground of a p>kasant frame, which he may have to-day, and want to-morrow; yea, whicb lie may not for a long season, enjoy i 1^ then, he would by daily actings of faith, derive solid and iiif* creasing consolation from the fulness of Christ ; be Hiust no longer ground his actings of faith, upoiv his feelings^ but, upon the immutableo£&r» and pro--mises of God who cannot lie* By building his con« fidence in Christ, upon the reports of sense, he builds it upon a *mrongy as well as a changeable,^ fbundatioi^; ax>d thereby he forfeits his comfort, instead of deriving aa increase of it. Faith cannot derive any increase, either of holiness or comfort,, from Christ, ;except the exercise of it proceed upon its proper ground. It is not the report of sense, but the record of God^ tliat is the true, and the warrantable, groupd of saving faitEu If the believer, then, would attain soUd.and increasing consolation, be must allow his faith to stand always, upon the record of God concerning his Son f lor that is the onlyi right ground of confidence- in the Son of God, for salvation, and is therefore iigrled the W9id Qf fiiitb. Then will he see tbat^

be has grouDd still to hold fast his confidence in-*-bis faithful Redeemer, when his pleasant frames are gone. Then will he learn, to retain the confidence of his heart, in his Divine Saviotir, even when the reports "of sense, contradict the report of the gospel; and, lik<i Abraham, ^^ against hope, to believe in hope." And in proportion, as he ceases to ground his confidence in'4:he Lord Jesusi for salvation, upon his comfortable feelings; be will receive that pure and everlasting consolation from Christ, which will be the pleasant fruity though ' not the ground, of his faitb^.

c In oi*dev to iilusti*atc, as well as to confirm, what has l)cen advanced in this particular, I cannot foihear transcribing the roo«t part of a Paragraph firom i?o-?if aine's Life of Faith, p. 61.—* Sense judges from what ifsees, and draws its inferences from wlUt it feels: so ^ that its report to the conscience, either of a bcliever^s stated or of his growth in it,- is not ftnm unchangeable things, which would settle the conscience in peace, but from changeable things, which leave room for continual dou4»ting. Sense also looks at the fi uits of faith, more than at the object of it; and if the believer has been ii^isled, and taught to confound these two together, he will be at great uncertainty in judging of his state : for instead of making^ the word of God, he will make his comforts, the ground of his faith ; and as these are more or less, so will his faith be. When he has comfortable feelings, -then he will think himself a believer j and * when lie has none, then he will think himself an unbeliever, changing his judgment of himself, as his feelings do, like the wind, anc) varying*as his comforts do, like the weather. This is a common case, I have seen the sad effects of it, in the lives of many of my «ifD^aaiiit-ance, who, from being taught thus to judge of theiQ-8elve9y were tost about for several years, np arid down, nhw comforted, then doubting, and could not get aoj sqIM eaEtaUisliiQittt > till Uis yrqril aud B|»irit «f Coi

16. It will be necessary also, for the same pur-pose, that the believer be always upon his^ guar^ against affected sadness. Has Jie already^ some happy measure of true,consolation ? Let him shew that he has it, by an habitual cheerfulness of temper, and of manner. Let him not, by assuming an air of gloominess, or peevishness, shew to any around him, that, he finds no comfort, in a life of communion with the blessed Redeemer. WhcH ^ believer is not afflicted with' trouble of soul^ and yet appears habitually dejected and gloomy; he thereby, in the view of others, gives the lie to the truth of his holy profession, as well as to the truth of God, in his promises of consolation*

convinced them, tbat sense was not to be the ground of their believing, nor the object to whicli they were to look. Sense judges by feeling, and reports what it see». Sense says, Now I am in the favour of God 5 for I feel k. Now he is my God ; for I find him so: I an? comforted. Now he demonstrates it to me y for I feel nearness to birh in prayer, and sweet answers. Now T am sure, imy duties and services are acceptable y for I am quite lively in them, find come from them, with warm affections. Now I canm^t doubt ^ for I feel the assurance of his love to me. And when sense has lost those comfortable feelings, then it draws contrary inferences—Now I am not in the favotir of God 5 for I do Hot feel it. Now he is not my God ^ for I do not find faim so: I am not comforted, &c. What can be the issue of this, but continual wavering and changing? For our feelings are sometimes more, sometimes less, as every believer experiences. What a state then must be be in, who has no way to judge of himself, but by those cbange-^le thiDg»! What room does he leave for continual 49ubtiBg, and what trouble and misery, does he thereby bring upon himself, as well as^ dishonour, to the im-chaugeableness of God in his pature and promises I'

He thereby, practically declares it to be false, that God " is the God of all comfort," that the Lord Jesus " h the Consolation of Israel," that the Holy Spirit is the Comforter, ftnd that " wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness:" By assuming an air of glpojniness, or of peerishness, he, instead of recommending the way of hoKness« brings reproach upiai that good way. Like the unbelieving spies, who, by bringing np an e%'il report of the promised land, discouraged the Israelites $ he represents the life of faith and holiness, as an uncomfortable, an unamia-ble life, and so discourages, more effectually than one can express, sinners around bim from tr}'ing to enter upon that life. Were he, on the contrary, by an habitual cheerfulness of temper and manner,, to exhibit the comforts of religion, so faf as he possesses them i he would rese^ible the .£iithful spies, who brought with them, dusters of the grapes of Canaan, that they might thereby, iavit^ their brethren to enter lliat good land* . jLt is bis duty, as be is infinitely obliged to the^ Lord Jesus, to promote always the honour oC.hii^ glorious xa^mcy Mid the interests of his ^ritual kingdom, taaox^g men. His whole behaviour Ui^ri^fore should h^ such, as would be the means of wjUuiing^soi^ to; the blessed Redeemer* The apostle Peter, exhort-eth wives to be in subjection to their own husbands; ^* that if any obey not the word, they also may, without the word, be won by the conversation of the wives V A holy man.should not only be, but appear to be^ habitually cheerful; that all who know hini| might have an opportunity of perceivings that'

M Pet ill. U

his blessed Sayiour hadi made him luippy^ as well as holy; and that his holy religion, instead of haying rendered him gloonq^, hath disposed him to be cheerfbl. Ccmsdousy that he is under the greatest obligations, to invite oUiers around bim^to ** taste and see that the Lord is good," let him, henceforth^ adopt this resolution of the holy Psalmist: ^ My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad '•" He has cause^ indeed, to be always humble and penitent; but no cause, to appear gloomy. A smiling aspect is eomelj ; and, doubdess, none have so good reason to be of a cheerful countenance, as the upright in heart* If the believer, then, would have lasting and increasing comfort, let him be continually upon his guard, against affected or pretended sadness; else he wiU provoke the Lord, to deprive him of his present degree of comfort, and to afflict him with real sadness. Although he does not always enjoy s^isible consolation ; yet he has the root and the habit of it, and has always good cause to rejoices Let him therefore be always cheerful, and on every occasion shew, that he can distinguish between gravity and sullenness, seriousness and gloominess i and let hkn never appear so ignorant, as once to insinuate it to be right or becoming, in any true Christian, to f^pear habitunlly sad and sullen.

17. If the believer would attain increasing tranquillity of mind, he must frequenib^ examine hisheavi and conduct;, in order that be may the more clearly discern his evidences of personal interest in ^iritual consolation* The more clearly, he per*

^ Pa* XXX Iw 2.

peives his personal interest in Christ, and in the covenant of grace; the higher, will the degree of his holy comfort usually be. ITie more di^gent^ ly, he scrutinizes his heart and life, comparing diem with the word of God, and the more fjre» queiitly and clearly, he perceives, in consequence of the witnessing of the Holy Spirit, his evidences of union and communion with Christ; the more, will his heart be comforted and encouraged $ the more, will he know that he is of the truth, and, with the greater confidence, will he assure his heart before God ^. Now, when he has it in view at any time, to examine himself, let him begin it, by renewing his act of trusting in Christ, for all his salvation, as well as, for the joy of that salvation. For, if be begin this inquiry, by doubting tliat the Lord Jesus will not save him, or by yielding to distrust and despondency; he will be afraid to search deeply into liis heart, or to know the worst of himself. But if he begin it, by an act of htimble and direct confidence in Christ Jesus, for salvation to himself in particular J he will be disposed, as well as encouraged, to deal impartially with himself: he will be willing to find out the worst, as well as the best, ©f himself. He will not be afraid to find that his heart, so far as it is unrenewed, is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked. Besides, by means of that acting of faith, his other graces will be invigorated, and excited to lively exercise; and the more he exercises them, the more easih/^ and the more clearly^ will he perceive them. Further, Jet him begin it also, by praying that, the Holy

^ I JoUiv \\L 1Q.| £I« .

Spirit may shine upon the graces which, he trusts, are implanted in his heart; and so, *^ bear wit* ness with his ovih spirit, that he is a child of God '." He may then proceed to try his graces: and he should try/ them by their nature^ rather than by the degree of their strength, or liveliness. Let him more especially examine himself, " whe* ther he be in ihefaithj and so prove himself"*." If he do not discern jtrue faith in his heart ^ yet, if he i« conscious of an earnest desire, to believe cordial* \y in Jesus Christ, accompanied by frequent en<^ deavours to do so; he ought to conclude that, he hath some measure of that precious faith. An ear« nest and habitual desire of grace, is grace, in the account of God " : and a man's desire of faith, of love, of hope, and of all the other graces of the Spirit, is sincere and earnest; when he desires them, for their own intrinsic excellence and amiableness, and chiefly, for the glory of God in Christ; md when, though he do not perceive them, he yet feels his need of them, and is conscious that he desires them, and desires even the perfection of them. Let the believer, then^ trusting that the Lord Jesus giveth him grace, and that the holy Comforter will, in every time of need, shine upon that grace in his soul, and render it apparent to himj enter frequently, upon the trial of his state and conduct: and if he find but one scriptural evidence of his being in .a state of grac^e, he ought for his comfort to conclude, that, he has all the other evidences of being in it, though he cannot at present, clearly perceive them. Nevertheless, he

* Rom. viii. 16. " 2 Cor. xiii. 5; ' ** Matth. v. 0.

should frequently pursue the important inquiry^ till he have the comfort of discerning clearly, all his evidences: for the move knqwledge he has, of his personal interest in the. blessings of salvatioD) die more consolation, he will enjoy.

Moreover, let the bdiiever search daily into his heaFt and life, in order to find out more of his sins^ and of his wants; that, by a deep and aSbcting sense of them, he may be urged to apply and plead frequently, the promises of pardon and of sanctifies* lion. This is- a necessary mean of .^* walking in the comfort of the Holy Spirit."

18. Finally, In order to advance in spiritual consolation, the believer must endeavour diligently, to mortify his/ear of death. Altl)ough death is, by the dimighty Redeemer, so disarmed of its sting and strength^ that it can do no hurt to any of his redeemed ; yet it is still a dreadfiil enemy to nature^ When the exercised Christian thinks of temporal death, as armed with the tremendous curse of the violated law, and as a punishment of sin; it assumes even to him, the grim and ghastly visage of ** the king of terrors." But when he contemplates it, as removed from the mrse of the covenant of works, to the promise of the covenant of grace; as no longer a curse, but a blessing; and as no more an enemy, but a friend, to all the spiritual seed of Christ; its terror should not make him afraid* Tlie apostle Paul said to the^ believers at Corinth^ *• Death is yotir*s^J' And concerning himself, he saith, " To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain P." John the beloved disciple,. <* heard a voice

MGor.iiL22. fi PhiUp..L21;.

from heaven, saying unto bira, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord ^" If temporal death, then, is an article in the inventory of the believer's treasure, and if as such, it is his in pro* mise; if it is gain to hini| and a blessing in dis* guise; why should he any longer, fear it with a slavish dread ? why should he suffer himself so to fear it, as, for a single moment, to lose the smallest degree of his holy consolation ? If a good man therefore would subdue, and rise superior to, his fear of death, let him, under the sanctifying influences of the Holy Spirit, studj', 1st, To fear sin more and more. As one wedge drives outanotherj so the godly fear of sinning, expels the slavish fear of dying. 2d, Let him also in the prospect of dying, commit frequently his soul with all the concerns of it, to his infinitely merciful and faithful Redeemer; and let him commit it, with unsuspecting confidence, to Him j trusting firmly that, as he is able, so he is willing, " to keep that which he hath committed to him, against the great day/' Let him constantly intrust to the Lord Jesus, the safety, the comfort, and the complete salvation, of his precious soul; and, as often as disquieting fear arises, let him sky with the holy Psalmist, " What time I aiti afraid, I tvili trust in thee'." " None who trust in Him shall be desolate '.'* Seeing the great Redeemer, ^* who liveth for evermore, and who hath the keys of hell and of death,^ iavitetby and even commandeth the saints, to trust him with their souls, their bodies, and all tlieir concerns; they may rest assured, that he will not deceive

<i Rev. x*T. 13. ^ Ps. Ivi. 3. • Ps. xxxiv. 22.

their expectation: no ; he will not deceive it; for he hath promised that, he ** will never leave them, nor forsake them ^" 3d, The Believer should, for the same purpose^ familiarize to his mind, the tbonghts of dying, and of his Redeemer's glorious victory over death and the grave. He OHgfat to meditate frequently on Christ's having, as his fe* , deral representative, disarmed death to the dying Christian. The almighty Redeemer, hath disarmed it of its sting and strength, and so, of all its terror. ** The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law ".'' Now the Lord Jesus ** hath put away sin^ by the sacrifice of him* self;" and he hath perfectly fulfilled the 2a<8?, by his obedience unto death. Thus he. hath, for the true believer, disarmed death of its venomous sting, and at the same time, of its strength or dreadful dominion. And what hurt, can the most poisonous and frightful monster do to him, when it has entirely lost, both its sting and its strength ? The Redeemer promiseth that, by taking away the sting, and the strength of it, he will be the plague of death, to his dt/ing saints. Nay,' he promiscdi that, by raising them up in glory at the last day, he will be the destructiofi of death, to his dead^XLinXs. <* I will ransom them," saith he «* from the power of the grave j I will redeem them fix)m death: 0 death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine eyes "^^ Accordingly, we read that he *• hath a-bolished death * 5" that is, he hath annulled, or re-

^ Heb. xiii. 5. « 1 Cor. xv. 5Q. ^ Hos. xiii. 14.

« 2 Tim. i. 10.

/

^uced it to nothing; or so destroyed it to all who believe in hinif as to have turned it from a curse to a blessing. How consoling then, how cheering is the thought, that death disarmed^ can dp no more barm to the dying believer, than if it had been com-^ pletely annulled ! It can, indeed, separate his soul from his body; but it cannot separate, either the one or the other, irom Him who is the living Redeemer, the resurrection and the life. The dying of a saint is but a sleeping: it is a sleeping in Jesus y. Death to him, is but " the shadow of deaths" it is not the substance. It is not the Omega, but the Alpha, of his consummate felicity: he then begins to live, when he begins to die. It is not the end, either of his soul, or of his body, but only a separation between them, for an ap-' pointed time. 4th, LiCt him also study, by an in-t creasing diligence, in the exercise of every grace, and in the practice of every duty, to be always actually, as well as habitually, prepared for death and judgment: for when he, in this manner, gives ^^ all diligence to make his calling and election sure;" he^ will, through grace, overcome gradually, the disquieting fear of death and judgment, and will rejoice in hope of eternal life *.

Thus I have endeavoured to point out, to the. exercised Christian, those principal means, of retaining and increasing spiritual consolation, which .he ought diligently to enploy. The illustration of

Tf 1 Thess. IV. 14. " * * Write do^^n the reasons \vhicb, at any time, make you afraid t6 die; atid then endeavou^, by faith, prayer,* : and conversation with experienced Christiaos, to remove . the causes.^ H£RV£ y's Kules, &c.

S60 THE MEANS OF INCREASIKG

such of diem, as the disquieted believer, was £» i-ected to use for the recovery of his forfeited coii^ fort, I have studied, as far as I could, to divernfy^ i have only to add that, if the ancere believer me them dHigently, and if, instead of resting in themi or depending on his use of them, he rely only upon his great Redeemer, for s3l grace and consolatioD; he will increase in the principle and habit of spiritual joy, and will in every time of need, be favoured with sensible comfort.

From what has now been discoursed, the pious reader may easily see that, no other pleasures under the sun, are to be compared to those of faith and holiness. The pleasure erf* true religion j or of communion with God, far surpass^ ail the other de-hgbts of the sons of men. In comparison of other plcasincs, it is pleasantness itself, pleasantness in die abstract The pains of sense, have frequently conquered and destroyed the delights of sense; hot those pains, instead of having been able to conquer the delights of faith and holiness, have, in ten thousand instances, been counterbalanced and conquered by them. And while the pleasures of sense, diminish ; the delights of religion, increase with the using. The longer a holy man continues, and tlie higher he advances, in the exercise of faith and practice of holiness, the greater and the sweeter, is his delight Besides, in order to enjofy^ and advance in the pleasures of religion ; he is npt called to relinquish any of the pleasures of sense, but such as are sinful, despicable, and productive of misery. Believer, as none faatli so much reason to rejoice, as thou, see that thou exercise and " in

crease tby joy in the Lord.'' Study to attain an increasing cheerfulness of disposition, and pleasantness of manner. These,, so far as they are spiritual, will greatly promote holiness in thyself, and will so adorn it, as to recommend it much to ethers.

Are spiritual knowledge and faith, principal means of advancing in holy consolation ? we may henoe infer that, those are usually the sweetest Jicurs in the life of a believer, in which, he has the deepest sense of his need of Christ; the clearest discoveries of the fulness and suitableness, of the willingness and glory, of Christ; and the firmest confidence in Christ, for the supply of all his wants. He commonly experiences the most solid comfort, when he is most enabled and excited, to intrust all his spiritual and temporal concerns, to his Divine Redeemer; whose power and grace, whose thoughts and ways, infinitely surpass the highest conceptions of men and angels.

ITiosc of the saints who have attained much sensible joy, may, from the foregoing particulars, see, how necessary it is for them to take heed, that the height of their joy, do not elate fkem *xii7i pride or sclf-siifficiency. The sensible joy of God's salvation, should never lift tlicm up with self-conceit ; and the want of such joy, should never cast ihem down, under disquieting and discouraging fear. The want of sensible jpj', should not for a moment, derive believers of their peacefiil ttan« quillity of mind. Their serenity of miod should be as great, when they are with Jesus on mount Calvary, sorrowing, as when they are with him on the mount of transfiguration, rejoicing. The

Q \

proper tendency of sensible joy is, to humble ;lnrt, through the depravity remaining in the heaiti it hath not always that effect Let such believers, therefore, as are favotired with sensible and five^ emotions of joy, take heed, that they never delight in them, so much as in Jesus, the Consolation of Israel; that they never yield to any temptatioo to rest in them, or trust on them; and, that tbcy never think themselves, the more holy, or the more acceptable to God, because of them. The more sensible joy, they experience, the more humble, as well as self-diffldeht, tliey should be, and .the more " fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.**

Lef such believers jis, by grace, have attained increasing consolation, learn from What has beea •said, always to take heed, that they do not suffer their fear of sinning, and of losing their comfort, to degenerate into a 'perplexing scrtipulousjiess of conscience. The npostle Peter exhorts believers, to " pass the time of their sojourning here, in fear * j" that is, in filial fear, which is a fear of sinning against God, their heavenly Father. The Christian, indeed, ought daily to attain more and more of this filial fear; but be ought also for hb comfort, to keep it within its due bounds, and not to siifler it to run out into a vain, and endless ^rupulosity of .conscience. He should, by studying the law of God, concerning sin and duty in every particular case, have his conscience well informed. If his persuasion, that this or that which presents itself to be done, is lawful and right, be jgrounded upon his knowledge of the spirituality,

• 1 Pet 1.1 r.

and great extent of diat holy law; his persuasion, in that case, may be ful! and firm ; and being firmly persuaded, that it is according ^' to the law and to the testimony," he should without scruple, resolve to do it. But, if his persuasion of the law-ftdHess of that, which he is requested or disposed to do, be grounded on opinion only; if he be of opinion miefdy, that it is agreeable tO the law, and SO not fiilly, persuaded; th^e will always remain, a secret doubt in his mind, that the contrary is his duty, and not this. In such a case, if the arguments for the lawfulness of it, appear to his Judgment, more probable, than those against the lawfulness of it; he should resolve to do it, without suffering his resolution to be sliaken by the latter. But, if the arguments against the lawfulness of it, appear to his mind, more probable, than tho6e for it, or even equally probable; in that case, doubting the lawfuliiess of it, he ought 9wt to do it: for the apostle Paul says, " He that <loubteth, is damned,^ o?*, (Condemned in his own t^iiscience, and by the word of God, ** if he eat, because he eatcth not of fakh: for whatsoever is not of faith, is sin *." Hie who does, what he himself docs riot determine to be lawful and right, but still doubts whether it be so or not, sinneth: for though he does that which may, in itself, and in the sight 6f God, be materially r/g/i/, yet he does it not rightly i because Iiq at the time doubteth wliefher it be lawful or not. In order to prevent jiis ftiiiiiitig in such cases, he should ^* be fully per« rsufided in his own mihd,^' of the kiwfulncss of an

^ Rom. xiv. 23.

action» before he resolves to perform it; and then, he will not condemn himself, in that which he allows himself to do. And when he is fiilly persuaded, that he may do this or that lawfully, and yet some objections to the contrary, occur to his

, mind, he ought not to delay doing it, till these xlifficulties be solved; for if he do, others may arise. Scruples will multiply, the more tliey are attended to \ and will damp the resolution, aixl so, mar the comfort of the exercised Christian.

Has any believer, after having been in the depths of spiritual trouble, not only recovered spiritual consolation, but attained an increase of it? His duty is, constantly to admire and praise those wonders of the wisdom, power, faithfulness, and grace of Christ, which he hath seen in those dcpths^ The floods of trouble, and the waves of terror, did beat vehemently upon his soulj but the Lord

. Jesus, who ** sitteth upon the flood," hath mercifully upheld him, and ^^ hath drawn him o.atof many waters." He hath seen the wonders of the Redeemer's wisdom, in dispensing to Jhiim, trouble

. and comfort, terror and hope, sorrow and joy; and in teaching him by these means, the malignity and bitterness of sin, and the preciousness and freeness of grace; the wonders of His power and love, in sustaining his fainting soul, under the pressure of his overwhelming distress j and the wonders of His mercy and faithfulness, in delivering him from the darkness of desertion, and in bringing him forth to the light of communion with Him-

;self. Let him then, with adoring gratitude, ad-

«Ps. cvi". 21.

liiir6 and praise these wonders; arid say with the holy Psalmist, " Thou art the God that doeth wonders**." He ought likewise with holy reverence, and ardent love, to say to his redeeming God, «* O Lord, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortest me®:" ** Thou hast turned for me, my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness; to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee $ and not be silent: O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever *".*' Be assured, O Christian, that ^* it is good to sing praises unto our God,' for it is pleasant, as well as comely ^:" it will in-fiise a double sweetness into all thy enjoyments. Though the Lord doth not need thy praises, yet be is glorified by them; and a growing disposition to praise Him, is necessary to thy own ad-Tancement in holy consolation.

To conclude: The Christian, who is favoured with the cheering light of God's gracious countenance, may, from what has been discoursed, see that, he is under tlie highest obligations to be more and more assiduous, in -using ail the means' of obtaining a daily increase of spiritual consola-' tion. The sweetness, and especially the useful-ness, of Iioly comfort, for the purposes of his Redeemer's glory, should excite him to unwearied diligence, in employing every appointed mean of attaining a daily increase of it. Let him live by-faith, grow in grace, and take heed that he do not"

His assurance of faith, is not an. assurance, that Christ hath already saved him; but it is a trusting, that Christ now savcth him, and that He will save him, with an everlasting salvation *: it is the simple, the direct confidence of his heart in the adorable Saviour, for sanation to himself in particular. It is always the dulj/^ though seldom the attainment^ of the believer, to receive the word, not only in assurance, but ** in much assurance ^ i" and in every act of worship, to draw near to his gracious God and Father, not only in assurance, but ^Mnyi///assurance of faith '."" Now, the way to attain establishment in solid consolation, is, through grace, to become established in this assurance of faith. The Christian must, for that end, not merely trust in the Lord Jesus, for complete salvation to himself; but he must endeavour to place a firm trust, a sieaii) affiance, a settled and an assured confidence, in that infinitely faithful Redeemer. It must be his habitual endeavour, to honour the exalted Saviour, not only with the confidence of his heart, buf with strong, unsuspecting, and unshaken confidence^ It will be necessary that, under the almighty operation of the Holy Spirit, he study diligently, to become ** established in the faith C* to •* continue in the faith grounded and settled ™;" and to ** hold fast the confidence, and the rejoicing of the hope, firm unto the end "."

By being established in the assurance or confix

dence of faith, the exercised Christian attains esr tablishment in spiritual comfort His establishment in> faith, does not indeed merit for him, establishment in consolation 5 but the latter, is in proper-, tibn to the'former, and is inseparably connected with it. Hence are these declarations of Scripture: •* If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not l>e established**." " Believe in the Lord j^our God, so shall you be established p/' ** Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace; Heb, in peace, peace, whose mind is stayed on thee; because he trustcth in tliee *>.'* To stay the mind on the Lord ^Jesus,- is to^repose nj^rm or settled confidence in him. Now the compassionate Saviour, will not suffer such a resolute believer, to continue oppressed and tossed with disquietude of soul ^ but He will, on the con-trliry, •* keep him in peace, peace;" that is, in all manner of peace, or in great, settled, and durable poace. This is the happy attainment df the man, «• who feareth the Lord, who delighteth.^rflr//^ in bid'commandments." << He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart isj^r^t?, trusting in the Lord. His \xe9xX.'\& established^ he shall not be afraid V Sudi joy-is'in'believing, or at least such peace, such undisturbed quietness, as is in no other thing in the world.- -It is,i)y means of his inwaird and assured confidence in ifae love, and care, and faith* fulness, of his great Redeemer, that the advanced believer is carried wonderfullvy and sweetly, through all the outward vicissitudes of life. .

God in him. Supreme love to God, is tlie principd grace, the spring of all the cHher graces in a holy souL It is, in particular, the principle of spiritual joy. In proportion as a holy man loves the Lord, and enjoys communion with Him, he delights and rgoices in him. He delights and rejoices ill all his perfections, and in all the manifested glory of them. He rejoices in the works and in the word of the JLord* H& delights in his preceptive and providential will; and in his holy image, whether he discerns it in himsetf, or in others. The infinite loveliness and love of God in Christ, are objects of his supreme delight. If, therefore, he is always loving and enjoying God, he is always in the same proportion, delighted ; and in proportion as he is delighted, he of course must be comfortable. K he is established in the faith of God's love to him, .and in the exercise, as well as in- the habit, of his love to God; he shall in the same degree, be established in ENvine consolation It will be an inexpressible comfort to him, to reflect that He^upou whom he hath set the supreme love of his heart, is infinitely worthy of it Besides, when he is established in his unfeigned love of God, he is pro-portionably confirmed in his hatred^of all sin; and in proportion as he is firm in his holy abhorrence of all iniquity, he is established in holy comfoit To be established, therefore, in supreme love to God and Christ, is the way to become established in the comfort of the Holy Spirit. Hence are these words of the apostle Paul, to the believers at Colosse; ** I would that ye knew what great.ooB-flict I have for you, and for them at Laodieea, and for as many as fative not seea my face in the flesh;

tiiat their hearts might be comforted, being knit

"together in love ^:'' as if he had said, ' I wrestle

with God in prayer for all the saints, that, as tliey

- already are firmly cemented together in cordial affection to Christ, and to one another; so, their hearts may be filled abundaBtly with holy consola-

• tion.' He prayed for the latter as a consecjnencc of the former. Love is the most delightful affection of the soul. When therefore it is set upon

-the Lord Jesus, who is altogether lovely, and who is, for that reason, the most deserving of it; the more fixed and strengthened it is, in the heart, the greater, must the delight, and the stronger, the

- consolation be, which it will produce. Accordingly, when our Apostle said, *^ Who shall separate

-us from the love of Christ^ ?"' it was with holy Joy, and even with triumph, tliat he expressed

- those words. O how inexpressibly delightful and cheeiing is it, constantly to love, and always to be loved by, Him who is ^< the chiefest among

- ten thousand, and altogether lovely,'^ yea,— love itself!

3. It will be necessary, for the same purpose, that the exercised Christian, be establislicd in- ^»-

- mUiiy and meekness.

He must be established in true At^/Mfy,. or evangelical humiliation of mind. True humility is, the ^eep and abasing sense, which a good man has, of his odiousness as a sinner, m the sight of God, of his vileness as a sinful creature, and of his utter insufficiency for his own salvation, and that, ac« companied by poverty of spirit* It is^ a true s^hi

and tense of the hatefuUiess of all sin, and of kb own odiousneas because of sin, attended with a disposition to abase himself and to exak bis-God and Saviour alone \ In earangelicai hamiliation, he is« made, not only to despair of ever being able to' help himsdf, but, to renounce himself in every, point of view, and freely to prostrate himself at the feet of Jesus Christ He hath ^if-abasifig views of himself, as an unworthy sinner, and admiring views of the Lord Jesus, as- an all-sufficient Saviour. He has also> a quick perc^tion of his own defects and.defilements, and especially of thejonVe of his heart; He is therefore like a little cbiUv afraid of takings a single stq>^ atone; and he is so conscious of weakoesSs and depravity within, and. of snares and dangers without, as to cry ccmtinual-ly to the Lord, to ** bold bim up that he may be safe." He is disposed to diink that, hia attainments in holiaess, are comparadi'ely small, and to count himself litde among saints, yea, even one of the very least of saints. And. the more he increases in humility **, the more does he see and feel, the afcrength of his comqptioDs, and tha wedmess of his graces; the jgreatness of his nfttural defiw-mity, and the smallness of hie spiritual attainments, in compisrison of what4ihey ought to be; the dec^ and dneadfixl jnalignity of the least of his sins,.

^ laa. ii. 11. ' ^ Tile saints increase ]ahun>ility, the nearer tbcy get to heaven. Paul, sonic years after bis conversion, said cf himself, That iie tnts **■ unworthy to be called an Apostle.^ As he advaiiced in holiaesfl,. he crieil^out, *' Less than the least of all saints." A little before bin death, his cry U ** The chief of sinaenu**

Hence, he becomes prcporticMiably poor in spirit, jBaad disposed^ in lowUness of inind, to esteem other saints, better than himadf ^. Now, to advance to eminence an<f estabiisbroent in true humility ^, is a special mean of attaining establishment in pure consolation. *^ Though the Lord be high, yet hath he respect «nto the lowly \** *^ Thus saith the high and^ lofty One, who inhabiteth eternity, whose name ia. holy, I dweU in the high and holy place; with him also, that is of a contrite and humble qpiritj, to revive the spirit of the humble V^ *^ He tliat humbkth himself shall be e^gaUed^" *^ Whoso-j&ver thi^eibre shall hmnUe himself, as this little fdiild, the same is greatest in the kingdom of hear ven \** Decip humility is, as it were, the guard oC spiritual consolatioBp as well as, the soil in which it grows.

It is no less necessary for the same end^ that the believer grow, and be established, in meekness* To l>e fUi^ek, is to be xif a mOd, soft, and gentle apirit. The Cbrisiian, by ^< putting on the nevK Huua, wUch is created in righteousness and true bolifoess,^ puts on ^^ the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit ^/' He is meek in proportion, as he is lioly* Ifoebaess is so much the character of eve9?[r

snint, that in Scrij)ture, the meek and the wickeJj are opposed one to another. " The Lore! lifielh up the vieck: he castMh the tcicked down to the ground *." Iri pwportion as a good man is meek, he is of a loving, a merciful, and a forgiving dis* position. At the feet of Jesusj-he-has learned to be meek and lowly in heart; and- therefore he is not captious,' nor casHy provoked, nor hard to be reconciled. If he meet with unkind*and unjust usage, he recollects that, though he has not deserved such treatment from ntett; yet, they are often the instruments employed by his-heavenlj FAtlier, to chasten, and to humble him. Now it' is in projiortion as'the Christian advances in holy meekness, that he increases in pure conso^ lation; and it is in as far as he is established in the former, that he is established in the latter. •* The meek shall inherit the earth ; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace'." Tliey shall inherit the earth. The earth, empty and transitory as it is, will be worthy to be styled an inheritance to them J for they shall enjoy - much of heaven upon earth. The more of a meek and quiet spirit, they attain, they more sliall they enjoy themselves and their earthly' comforts; • and tlie more quietly and comfortably,- shall they pass through the world, whatever ihehr lot in it may be. ** Learn of me," snitKthe Lord Jesus, ** for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls °^."

4*. If the believer would reach establishment iA holy comfort, he must study daily to grow in grace* It must be his earnest and continual endeavour, in the faith of God's free favour to him, to grow stronger and stronger in the habit, and to abound more and more in the exercise, of every grace implanted by the Holy Spirit in his soul. By so doling, spiritual declension and the loss of comfort will, under sanctifying and consoling influences, be happily prevented. The apostle Peter, in order to prevent the believers to whom he wrote, fi'om being so led away with the error of the wicked^ as te fall from their own stedfastness, directed them to. " grow in grace p.'* Believers, " holding the head; and having nourishment ministered," ought in point of duty, as well as of privilege, to " increase with the increase of God **.*' It i» their duty, to *.* grow up into Christ who is the head," not only in all tilings, but at all times ^ Their path should always be " as the morning light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day •/' They ought at all times, to grow inwardly, by faith and love, cleaving more firmly to Christ the head of gracious influences; to grow outwardly, by being more and more fruitful in good works '; to groW: upward, in heavenly mindedness, and joy in God ^ ; and to grow downward, in humility, and self-de** nial ^. To grow thus in grace, and to grow conr tinually in it, is the sure way to attain establish^-ment in spiritual comfort. For, the more a holy

He Qses lawful lihjngs, in an tmUmfid taanner, and so ;tran8gresse8 *the law of God. He ^ sets Atesm ttp as idols ia his heart; and, by his iiv)cdinafte and Ksdue affection-to them, he impairs his inwunji consolation, and provokes his heavenly Fathevv even to ilea^e him for .a season, without the com* fort of comBsuaion wi^h Him. Now, the love jof earthly things, and the deceitfidness of ain, ydbidi: remain in the heart >of ithe believer, are such, that they will continually expose him to the dai^er, of sinning in &ae or other of .^ose ways, in his purip suit or iuse of lawful things. If, then^ he would advance to establishment in spiritual comfort,hemust continually take heed, that he^o not, in a sinfiiji manner, pursue and en|oy lawful comforts. It wiH be necessary, that be >be at ail times, '< sober and Tigiiant i* lest he at any time, so love the world.,.

as to use lawful things in a sinful manner. And it must be his constant endeavour, through grace, sd to use his outward comforts, as to enjoy the inward comfort of communion with Christ, in his use of them. He must always live above them, and never place his happiness in them. He ought, to keep them constantly in their own place; and to value them, not so much for themselves, as for the opportunities and facilities, which th^ afford himj of ^orifying his God and Saviour.

6. In order to be established in pure consolationi it will be no less necessary, that the Christian be firmly fixed in his resolution and endeavour, to avoid those places^ and that company^ which appear to have even a remote tendency^ to draw him into sm. He must for that purpose, be always finn in. his resolution, never without evident necessity, or a clear providential caH, to be present in the com* pany of worldly land wicked men ; and when at any time, he hath such a call, never to stay longer in their conipany, than till his business with then), be transacted. He ought on all occasions to shew them, that he loves their persons, but not thciv company ; and, that he is ready to do them all the good that he can, but not to countenance them in any evil. It must also he his firm resolution, never to venture into their company, how .clear soever his call be, till after he have intrusted his temper, his manner, and his object, to that Saviour who ** preserveth the souls of his saints ^ ;" and who hath said to each of them, " I wiJI teach theo on the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee

f Ps.-xcvii. 10..

with mine eye ^." It is his duty to maintain constantly, a holy jealousy over himself; and, having tasted the sweetness of heavenly consolation, to live as distant as possible, from the ensnaring society of worldly men. As he cannot approach too near to God, so he cannot stand at too great a distance £rom sin. It will not therefore be enough for him, to keep himself merely from acts of sin: he must endeavour constantly, to ^< abstain even from all . appearances of evil,'' and from that company, and those amusements, which have even a remote tendency to lead him into sin. Such conduct will, indeed, expose him to the contempt and ridicule oi ungodly men. Some will account him, a designing ■ hypocrite; others, a precise formalist j and othens, a weak and gloomy enthusiast. Be it so: *' his witness is in heaven, and his record is on high ^.' He can say that, never till he believed in Jesus Christ, did he know what it was, to enjoy real pleasure, or true satisfaction. He can from experience attest that, communion with Christ in his redeeming love and grace, is so delightful, so cheering ; that one who has tasted the sweetness of it, cannot but desire more and more of it, in preference to all the mean gratifications, the poUuted delights, of carnal men. The men of the world, therefore, should cease to wonder, if the experienced Christian so conduct himself, as to evince on fill occasions,* his firm resolution, to prefer the marrow and fatness of pure consolation, before the busks of vanity and sin. Indeed, such a resolution, manifested by a suitable conduct, is indispensably necessary to jestablisbcd comfort: for, though

« Fa, xxxii. 8. * Job xvi, 19.

the former doth not merit the latter, yet the oneii inseparably connected with the other. The more firmly fised» a sunt is, in his holy resofaition and endeaTOur, always to avoid whatever hath a known tendency to draw him iiUo sin; the mdreestahliib-edy shaD he be^ iil his enjoyment ofeveridstiIIgc<lI^ solatioll; ** I haVe not sat with vain petsonS,'' wfi the holy Psalmist, <' neiUier wifl f go m With db^ semUers.

He shall be like a tree planted by the riven of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his sea* son: his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doth shall prosper." The ungodly are not .so K**

7. If the advanced Christian, would arrive at establishment in spiritual comfort, he must attain «ome degreeof eslabliskment in fie assurance of sense. The assurance of sense, is an assurance of vital union with Clurist, or of personal interest in him, founded on scriptural evidences thereof. It is the believer's certain knowledge of his being united to Christ, and is built on the sense or experience^ which lie has, of his possessing those evidences of union and communion with ChHst, which are stated in the Scriptures. In this place, I shall take notice only cA'three of those evidences.

1st, Saving yc/M, is a sure evidericd of union with Jesus Christ Whilst, according to the covenant of grace, feith is the instraitrent of vital

^nion with the second Adam; it is at the same time, an eridence of that nnioo. ** He that eat-eth my flesh," saith the Lord Jesos, *< and drink* .etb my blood, dwcHeth in me, and I in him K*^ *< Verily, veriiy, I say imto jon, He thatbdiereth on me hath ererhtting fife"." <* He that belier-eth, and is baptized, sfaafl be sated *." If an ex-endsed Christian, have jnst and distinct views cS die nature of tme faith, as dedared in the Scrif)-^nres; if he deaily nnderstand^ iAaat it is to &g^ lieve Clmst, and what it is to believe in him ; and if, at the same time, his actings of ikith be direct and lively; he w:}*, under the witnessing of the Holy Spirit, be less or more coriscifjits of them. He will be enabled to reason thus: ** He who be-lievetb on Jesus Christ, dwelletb in him, and hnth everlasting life * i* but I am conscious that I Iw-Jieve on him: therefore I dwell in him, and have the bejjinninsrs of eternal life: Whosoever believ-eth on the Lord Jesus, is united to him, and •* shall be saved^ :*' but I believe on him: there-SoTC I am united to him, and I shall be saved. j\nd in order to be satisfied, tiiat his actings of fiiitli, are unfeigned, or not h^-pocritical *>; let him*, in ilependance on the wilightening influences of the Spirit of truth, attend carefully to the distinctions, marked in the sacred Volume, between a true, and a counterfeit faith. There he shall find that, if a man, convinced of his sin and misery, believe the .record of God, with application to himself, and with cordial approbation of the whole plan of i:e-

demption by Jesus Christy that, if he trust itt Jesus for salvation, not upon the ground of previous qualitications in bimselfi but solely upon the warrant afforded by the gospel-offer, call, and com-roandment to believe on the name of Jesus Christ'; that, if he rely, not like the hypocrite, partly on his own performances, and partly on the righteousness of Christ, but on the righteousnc^ss of Christ onfy, for all his title to eternal life *; that, if he trust in the Saviour, not for salyation in sin, or to sin, as the hypocrite does, but for ^yation/rom all iniquity, and especially from the sin that easily besets him, or in other words, for the 'xAole of salvation '; that, if he trust for tliat salvation onlt/j which is wholly of sovereign gi-ace, and in which, the glory of redeeming grace, is most illustriously displayed " ^ and that, if his faith work by lo^^e, and purify the heart:—there he shall find, I say, that, if a man exercise i/iis iaitli, and be conscious that he exercises it, he may consider it as a good evidence, that he is united to Christ, and interested in his righteousness and salvation. That is " the faith of God's elect." It is « a believing with the heart unto righteousness ^ ;** ** a trusting in the Lord with all the heart ^ i*' and, therefore, when the Holy Comforter shineth upon it, as his own work in the soul, it cannot fail to be a comfortable evidence to the Christian, that he is in a state of grace.

A pious mother dearly loves' her mucking child; but she never complains, that she loves it too little: whereas, she often laments, that she ioves the Lord Jesus too little, and often fears^ that she loves her infant more,'or at least as much, •as she loves .Him. But these^ complaints and fears are {)roofs, that her affection to = her Saviour, is greater, than it is to her diild. They shew, Hiat she sees much more reatoo to love and admire Him, than to love the most amiable of creatures; iind^ that she.wishes to esteem Him, and to delight

in hiiti, more than in any creature. The moie a saint feels, and bitteriy bewails, the coldness of Ui affection, or the siniiil deficiency of his love to bis God and Saviour; the more eyidence has he, of the sincerity of his love to him. The hypocrite pretends to love the Lord, but he never loaths himself in his awn sight, for loving him too little; fer he thinks that he loves him a great deal, and ii even proud of the greatness of his love to hkn. "Whereas the uncere believer, 'knowing diat it .is a sinful, an abominable defect, not to love Him, even iy a perfect degree; loaths himself often in secret, for the criibinal imperfection, of bis love to him.

Unfeigned love to the brethreny flowing from supreme.love to God, is likewise a sure evidence of union and communion with Christ. '^ By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another *^." ** We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren **." ^* My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth.

If, then, a man be conscious that, whilst he loves .all others, as creatures of God, with a love .of benevolence^ he loves all the saints, witii a love of complacence^ that, be regards all, with cordi^^ esteem and affection, to what denomination soever they belong,-who appear jto be saints of the Most High; that, he is pleased

3d, The practice of universal holiness, or dbedi'' ence of heart and life^ to all the hommandments of the Moral law as a ride of Itfb, is likewise, a sure evidence of a raaii^s unioii aiid communion with Christ. <* He that hath my commandments, and keepeth fthem,'* saith this Lord Jesus, " he it is that kweth tne**.'' *« Therefore^ whosoever hearetfa these sayings of mine, and doth them, I wM liken him unto a wise man who built his house upon a rock *."

" Whoso keepeth his word, in him, verily, is the love of God perfected: hereby knam xoe that we are in him *=•*' " He that keepeth his command-liients, dweUeth in him^ and he in him '/' The behaviour, or practice of every man, who is vitally united to the holy Jesus, is universally conformdl to the law as a rule of doty. Such a holy practice, is the grand business of his life; the business in which, he is chiefly engaged, and which, he pursues with more earnestness and diligence, than he does, any other. His understanding is divinely enlightened, to see the transcendent beauty of holiness, his will is renewed, to choose holiness, and his afiections are sanctified, to love, desire^ and delight in it. He is also constrained by the love, , commanded by the law, and enablefl by the Spirit, of Clirist, to be ^' holy in all manner of conversation "!." He, therefore, makes the constant practice of universal holiness, his choice, his delight^ and in an eminent degree, his employment. Relying on the righteousness of Jesus Christ, for all his title to eternal life, trusting in Christ for continual supplies of grace, and aiming in all his performances, at the gko'y of God; he perseveres, through all changes, and under all trials, in the love iind pi:actice of universal holiness, tt» the end of life. He may indeed be left to be guilty, in ^ome degree, of spiritual declension, and may be suffered to yield so far to some temptations, as

even to fall occasionally into great sins 5 but, he shall never be permitted so to fall, that it will cease to be his manner^ even in the most difficult situa-tionsy to perform sincerelyy all duties required of him, even the most hard.

Now, when a man is conscious that, relying on* the suretiship-righteousness of Jesus Christ, for all his title to life eternal, that, trusting in Christ, for all promised supplies of sanctifying grace, and believing the love which God hath to him, he is enabled, cordially to perform obedience to all the commandments of Christ; when he finds that, he is enabled to yield universal obedience, not, that it may secure him from heJI, or entitle him to heaven, not merely, because he is bound to perform it, but^ Because he is constrained by the love of Christ, and; because he wishes and delights, and resolves to da it; when \i% is conscious that, he pursues and practises universal holiness, according to the law as a rule, from principles of supreme love to God, and of unfeigned gratitude to Jesus Christ, who fulBUed all righteousness for him, according to the same •law as a covenant; and, when he knows by experience, that he has been enabled, under manifold trials, resolutely to cleave to Christ and his word, and habitually to make tlie glory of Christ, and of God in Hi||i, the chief end of all his performances: —*he ought to consider this holy obediencej as a-sure, a distinguishing evidence, that he is united to the Lord Jesus. Indeed, universal holiness of heart and of life, is the most sure, the most unex-»-ceptionablc, evidence of a personal interest in Christ. It is the sign of signa^ the chief of all the signs of grace. No faith, is an evidence of union ^Wli

Christ, but that which is mode perfect by vorks^ No love, is a sign of it, but that which is perfect^ cd in keeping his word ®. Holy practice, is the highest evidence of connection with the holy Je* gus; the great mark of distinction» betwe^ the children- of God, and the children of the de^ vii^. It is very remarkable, that this evidieAce is much more insisted on in the Scriptures, than any other. <^ Blessed are the uudcfikj m the way, who walk in the law of the Lord**.*^ << Then shall I not be ashamed, whtn I have respect unto all thy commandments '.** " If ye love me," saith our Lord, ** keep my commandments.'^ ^* If a man love me* he will keep my words.

Whosoever doth not righteousness, is not of God "." « This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments ^." The man, therefore, who is truly conscious that, from principles of faith and love, and for the glory of God, he forsakes with abhorrence, every known siq^ and stu* dies to know, and to perform cordially, every commanded duty ; may warrantably assure himself, that he is united to Christ, and is in a state of grace. Let the believer, then, endeavour dili^ent-

]y, to attain more and more of this high evidence of grace: so shall he arrive, not only at sensible assurance of his union with Christ, but, at establishment in that assurance. Indeed, when a man trusts, with cordial and strong confidence, in Christ Jesus for salvation, he trusts that Christ will qffbrd him evidences of salvation ; and the consequence will be, that his mind will never be entirely at ease, till he see that he has, at ileast, the evidences above mentioned. Whatever degree of the assurance of Jaithy he attains, he will in the same degree, be diligent to attain, as soon as possible, the assurance of sensey and establishment in this assurance.

And here, I must remind the exercised Chris* tian, that how diligent soever he may be, in the practice of holiness^ he cannot attain this holy, as* surance, much less establishment in it, but by the testimony of the blessed Spirit, the Comforter. It is the same Holy Spirit, who bath implanted in hi» Iiieartj all saving.graces, that can, by shining upon them, make him ^* kmm the things which are freely given to him of God"." As the sua cannot be ^en, but by its^wn light \ so the graces and fruits jM* the.

by shining upon these, by exciting their attention to them, anti by enabling them to compare them ^ith the signs of adoption, mentioned in Scriptare, concur with their consciences, in witnessing that ifliey are the children of God««.- In order then, to attain such establishment in sensible assurance, as will introduce establishment in spiritual comfort, the Christian must irequentl3r tpust, as well as pray, for the witnessing of the Holy Spirit; and he should continually take heed, that he do not grieve the Spirit *.

8. Moreover, In order to his being established in pure consolation, the believer must endeavour, with all diligence^ to make a rigJU tuid profitable ttse of the holy Saeraments. These are the aeals of the covenant ef graoe; for they were instituted, in order to cojifii'm that holy covenant with true believers ^. They, accordingly^ in the hand of the Holy Comforter, are special means of (^nfirminj that everlasting covenant with them: and they confirm it with them, not by making it firmer in Itself, than it is already; but by confirming their Jaith of it, and by clearing up, or confirming to them, their personal interest m it, and in all the blessings promised in it. • -*

The believer, then, in order to be established in spiritual comfort, roust improve Ats baptiim^ both for confirming his assurance of faith, andibr confirmuig his assurance of personal interest, iii the everlasting covenant He ought for these purposes, to improve it at all times, but especially when he is called, either to present a child for baptism, or to witness

Ute dispensation of baptism, to the child of another; Seeing baptism, in the room of circumcision, is a* seal especially *^ of the righteousness of faith ^ ;" he should^ in witnessing the dispensation of it, renew his cordial application of the spotless righteousness of Jesus Christ,, which, in the gospel, *« is revealed from faith to faith." Since the water in baptism, represents the cleansing virtue of the blood and the Spirit of Christ ^ i he ought, when, he sees the baptismal water applied to the body, to seize tlie precious opportunity afforded him, of applying the justifying blood of Christ, to his con*^ science, for cleansing it from the guilt and pollution, and.the sanctifying Spirit of Christ, to his, heart, for cleansing it from the power, of sin. And, Inlying, on the righteousness and blood of Jesus,? for a complete title to deliverance from the gnilt,:, the power, and the }X)lIution of sin, and trusting in .the Lord Jesus himself, for all hi» salvation ; he. siiould then within himself say, * A& certainly as I. have now seen the baptismal watery sprinkled upon the body of that infant, the blood and the Spirit of. Christ arc miW, not only in ofiev^ but in possession; and while they are mine, to justiiy, sanctify, and comfort me,. Christ himself is mine, as n^y Cove-' nant-head, and Gkxl is mine, as my Covenant-God, . Jrom henceioFth and for ever.' And seeing that tlie. child is, in its baptism, solemnly dedicated to the luord, he ought further to say, < O Lord, I devote myself, and all that I am, to thee, to be thine wholly, only, and for ever, to be saved by thy grace^. dnd to be employed for thy glory.-.

That the exercised Christian, may attain esta-^ blmhment in true consolation^ he must likewise improve the holy Sacrament of the Suppers he must, ivith increasing diligence, improve it for the Gon«-firmation, both of his assurance of faith,- and of his* assurance of union and communion with his^ great Redeemer. When,- afler due preparation, he hath sat down at the Gommnnioii-table, he ought, with suitable affections, not only to remember and meditate on, the amazing love of Cbristj in serving and suffering iop^him $ but, upon seeing the sacramental bread given him, to say, ^ As certainly as the sacred bread is- now given me, with a oommand to take, and to eat of it,. Jesus my gracious, my crucified Redeemer, is now given me in offeri and the offer, together with the commandment to believe on his name, affords me a warrant to accept, and to trust in Him.' And,, when he is taking and eating of the bread, he-should from his heart say, ^ O Lord Jtens, I, upon the warrant of thy offer and command, now accept thee as-* my only Saviour^ and trust with firm confidence,, in thee, for* ali my aalvadon*^ Upon seeing the onp of blessing ^piesoited to>him, he riioukl not forget to say, < As certainly as this cup is now given me, with my Redeemer^^^ express-command to drink o/ it, his rigkttaHsness^-.and alt the promises and blessings of the new testament in his: blood, are given me in qffkrj and the offitir, together with the commandment to believe on bis name, affi>rds; me a full right to receive and sely am them.'

Lastly, If the beliercr would attain established consolation, he should endeavour diligently, according to the opportunities afibrded him, to pro-im>te the extension jGud establishment^ of the Redeemer's spiritual kingd6m. This is a sure mean of his arriving- at solid, and durable comfort. << Pray for the peace of Jerusalem r they shall prosper that Ibve thee *." ** Let them shout' for joy and be glad, that favour my righteous cause; yea, let them say contimially, Let the Lord be magnified, who hath pleasure fn the prosperity of his servant '•" '* I will'make thee air eternal- excellency, a^joy of many generations V ♦* Rejoice ye with JeroaaMro, and be glad with lier^ all ye that love her: rejdce' ibr joy with her, all- jre that mourn for her; that ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her conflations; that ye may liiilk out, and be de>*

fighted with the abundance of her glory *." When the apostle Paul, had reviewed the success of his ministrations among the Corinthians, he addressed them thus; <^ Great is my glorying of you : I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation V The constant and earnest endeavours of the saints, to promote and extend^ ac^ cording to the law of Christ^s kingdom, the inte-^ rests of his Church militant, do not indeed entitle ihem to stable comfort; but they are usually con^ iiccted with it. The glorious King of Zion hatb-decreed, that they who, by his. grace, are habitual-Jy disposed to contribute, by their prayers, their labours, and their substance^ to promote so great and so glorious a design ; shall, even in this valley of tears, participate witli him of that ineffable joy, wherewith he always rejoiceth over his church \ If a Christian, instead of being of a liberal and a public spirit, is contracted in hi& views^ and concerned mainly, for his own welfare, and that of a particular party; he is not qualified for strong, and durable consolation. Established comfort,, like fame, will elude the grasp of him,> who pursues it merely or chiefly, for himself, and /or its own sake. One reason, perhaps, why some believers at this day, have Jittle spiritual and lasting eomfort^ is, that in comparison ef it, they care little for any thing else. If they were more em-pk)yed in seeking the glory of Christ, the success of his blessed'gospel, and the extension- of his spi* ritual kingdom, both at home and abroad, than in seeking ease and comfort for themselvesj. they

Ought sincere believers to endeavour, with all diligence, to attain establishment in the assurance 9f faith, as a primary mean of attaining established comfort? It ipUgws, th^t ev^ry believer should

Constantly strive to attain a stro7ig faith. Without a strong (ind a lively faitb^ the Christian may haire comtort, but he cannot have settled comfort; he cannot be habitually cheerful; he cannot ^^ tiss joice evermore;" he cannot cleave resolutely to the promise, when providence without, or sense within, aeems to contradict the promise. It is on^* ly by* 1^ strong feith, that the believer can live, as a child in the iamily lives,—without anxious care or fear "*. As often as Christ removes the burthen of contracted guilt,, from the conscience, the weak believer lays i| on again, and then sinks under it ;^ but the strong believer takes the Saviour at his word, and reU^ with firm confidence, on Him^ for pardon and eternal life. Thus, being strong, iji fiiith, hfe glorifies God, and God, according to his faith, comfortettx him. If his heavenly Father do at any ^me, frown upon him and smite him; he believes His love» rather tlian his own feeling. Weak faith says, * The Lord Jesus can save me if be will;' but strong iaith says, * He both can and will save me.' The strong believer lives, not so much upon the comlbrts of God, as upon *^ the God of all comfort.'* He draws his consolation from the higher springs, even while the waters of the Ipwer springs, are rillining. And were all his^ earthly comforts to fail him, he knows that he hath still one comfort, which is of infinitely more value than them all:—*^ Jliis God is my Ged for ever Bfid ever ^.*^ He trusts finply* ^<>r all necessary consolation, in his God and Saviour who change not; and therefore, no outward changes which

» DftD. iii?. 16, 11, Ps. xxjii, 4, 6. " P»« xiviiL 14.

befal, can effect any considerable change in bur spirit. He knows that he cannot be poor, so lonj^ as his Covenant-God is rich j for all the riches of God are his. O believer, strive diKgently to at^ tain a strong, a vigorous, and an operative faitL Watch, and resist, the veiy first appearances of declension in the life of faith: Hold fast the truth, in opposition to errors of every kiiid. Hold it fast, in thy. understanding and judgment, in thy will and affections, and in thy confession and whole conversation. ** Hold fast the faithful word, as thou hast been taught ^.^ Keep the truth, and the truth wiU keep thee comfortable and happy* Seek for an established judgment, and a firm faith, in all the truths of the glorious gospel.

Should the Christian, in order to arrive at stable comfort, endeavour to be ** rooted and grounded in love?'' Then, he must study, in the faith-of God's redeeming love to him, so to love God in Christ, as to be at all times pleased with Him. In proportion as he loves his God and Father, he will be pleased with him, with all his perfections,- and with all his will r and if he be always pleased or delighted with God, he will In the same proportion, be always comfortable, always delighted in his own soul. To be constantly pleased with God iii Christ, and with all the will of God, is, indeed, a difficult and high attaiimient; but the believer cannot otherwise, become so rooted and grounded in love to him, as to attain settled consolation. To love Grod supremely, and to be so pleased with him, as to be constantly disposed, in all things, to

^ilease him, are in efTcct the same. If, then, a ^ood man would attain established consolation, he must, by grace, become firmly fixed in a holy and habitual endeavour, always to be pleased with God, .and always to please him. One happy consequence would be, that trusting and praying, only for such things as are agreeable to the holy will of God, he loidd not be disappointed; and another would be^ that loving the providential will of the Lord, he would frequently observe providence, and would perceive such traces of love to him, in providential dispensations, as would greatly establish him in spiritual consolation.

Whilst unfeigned love to the brethren is, as has been remarked above, an evidence of union and communion with Christ; it appears at the same i^ime, to be an instituted mean of establishment in, spiritual comfort. By the exercise of sincere love to the brethren, a holy man enjoys communion with them i which heightens his enjoyment of communion with Christ. The more he loves them, the more is he disposed, to ^' cover a multitude of sins in them **," and to " think no evil of them V It is want of love to the saints, that usually dis« poses a man, so to quarrel and contend with them, as to mar his own comfort in fellowship with them. Hence, the apostle Paul exhorted the believers at Corinth, to ** be of one mind," and to " live in .peace,'' in prder that they might be of good comfort'. He urged brotherly love and unanimity, , upon those at Philippi, by an argument drawn from

The mwre a believer loves the brethren, the more pleasure does he* take in them i and the more pleasure he takes in diem, and in their company, the more pleasant will he be to them; and the more disposed will he be, to << be of one accord, of one mind with them,^ and ^* in lowKness of mind, to esteem them better than himself'^ His love of diem, and his del%ht in their company, will render him very unwillfng to deprive himself of the comfort of their society, by difiering without necessity, in opinion from them. The diversity of opinions in religion, among Christians at this day, and the divisions which ensue, are, I believe, as much owing to the want of perfect love to the brethren, as of perfect knowledge. Ought the believer to be always firm in his resolution, to avoid such company, as appears to have a tendency to draw him into sin ? then, he must learn never to feel uncomfortable^ far less to murnmr, when men of the world, appear not to esteem him. The exercised Christian^ is always a fool in the account of worldly men ; and he will not a little, mar bis own comfort, if he look for respect from them. He ought never to expect, that they will esteem him as a holy man^ so long as they do not regard holiness itself. Indeed, it would discover both ignorance and pHde in him, to murmur when they slight him. He is unknown to worldly and wicked men; and therefore be should not for a moment, be unea^, if he find himself disregarded by them. Najr, if he wooM attain establishment in heavenly <X)nsoIation, he

* Philip, ii. 1—3,"

must not sttfibr himself to be in the least, disquiet-ei ; though he.should find that, even some of the saints themselves, appear to disregard him. He should remember, that even the holiest of men, can in no higher, degree be attentive to him, than the Loi^d is pleased at the time, to make them.

Is establishment in humility of mind, requisite to a sainfs establishment in pure and holy comfort ? the believer may hence learn that, the more de^ and abiding^ his sense of weakness is, the stranger he is. The strongest believer has, in one sense, no more strength inherent in himself, than the tweakest. He is as incapable of resisting motions of sin, and of performing spiritual obedience, by his own strength, as he was, when he first began to know the Lord. In another sense, however, he is more strong, and more firmly settled in holy tranquillity of soul; because he has a more deep and feeling sense of his own weakness, and un« worthiness, and a more constant dependance ort Christ, for continued supplies t>f grace. Thus he is strong, not iii himself, but " in the Lord, and in the power of His might:" and the sti-onger he is, ** in theigrace that is in Christ Jesus," the stronger will his consolation be*

It is also evident from what has been said, that, as the peace which believers have in Christ, doth not exempt them £ix>m outward afiiiction in the world ; so they ought to take heed, that outward affliction do at no time, deprive them of^ or even lessen^ their inward peace and consolation in Him. Outward and even inward trouble, are dispensed to saints, in order not to destroy, but to in-^crease and establish, their holy tranquillity and joy

in the Lord Jesus ^ A^Oiictions are sent, diat tliejr may be means of prq)aring them, for deriving in^ creasing degrees of spiritual and strong consolation) from his fuhiess. When the sufferings of Christ, or any calamities whatever^ abound in them ; it is not, in order that their consolation may diminish, but that it may abound hy Christ". If afl9ictions are dispensed, it is, to take smaller comforts out of the way, or to make them cease to be any longer, comforts, in order to make room for greater. Be-Uevers, therefore, when they are under affliction of any kind, should never suffer their grief, or their fear, to hinder them for a moment, from trusting and rcgoicing in Christ Jesus, who is a brother born for adversity. On the contrary, while they are under trouble, as well as after they are delivered from it, they ought to fall in so enUrdy, with the gracious design of God in dispensing it, as resolutely to endeavour to confide, and to rgoice, in the great Redeemer. Thus, ^* their hearts will be fixed, trusting in jjbe Lord j'^ and they will en-Joy a peaceful and a stable tranquillity, in the midst of a changing and a troublesome world. Thus, desiring above .all things, and trusting, that the infinitely sovereign, wise, and holy !will ofGodf may be accomplished in them; tliey will rejoice in the cheering thought thai^ in subservience to the glory of Christ in their salvation, ^^ all things work together for good to them ^." AfiSicted be^ liever, thy grief, arising from what -thou feelest, either of the plague of thy heart, or of the pressuve of thy calamity, should never be suffered to rob

deed, the duty of Christians, often to examkie their state and their frame, and to see that they are not decei^g themselves; but, not to be doing it ofihi) and incessantly; not to' be occupying themselves with that, when they are called to faith and love, to patience and holy activity for God. Were those of the saints, who are favoured widi comfortable discoveries of their evidences of inherent holiness, to take frequent occasion from those evidences, to think of Christ, and to set their hearts the more, on his consummate righteousness, as the only ground of their title to holiness and comfort; they

<: would thereby, attain more assurance of their personal interest in him, and more estaUishment in pure consolation. When the apostle Paul was assured, that Christ already lived in him, be took occasion from that, to live the more by faith^ on the righteousness and fulness of Christ. '* I live," says he; " yet not I, but Christ liveih in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the

faith of the Son ©:* God, who loved me, and gave himself for me 5^.'* At the very time in which, the same Apostle had his eye fixed, upon his having th/e excellent knowledge of Christ Jesus; he had his heart taVen up with the righte&usness of Christ ■. If the believer, then, would maintain solid and stable comfort,'' let him think more of the Lord

, Jesus, and delight more in Him, and in his righteousness and fulness, than in his own evidences of grace. To pore upon his inherent holiness, more than upon his imputed righteousness, would soon interrupt and lessen his tranquiOity of mind. Evl-

^dences are, indeed, delightful to an exercised Chris*

4itin; but Christ ought to be far more deligbtfur^ to bim.

Such <tf the salhts, as are favoured with strong and stable consolation, may hence learn, to express their gratitude for this inestimable blessing; by the frequent exercise oj holy joy* They should ■ abound much, in the lively exercise of joy and^ praise. When,their souls are satisfied as with mar* row and fatness, their mouths ought daily to praise the Lord with joyful lipjs. Their ** lips should greatly rejoice, when they sing unto him, and their souls, which he hath redeemed." Every stream of Divine consolation, which flows in, ought to lead them up to the uncreated fountain of joy, and Xxii--excite them to the exercise of rejoicing always \xk ^ the Lord. They should place their happiness andr their delight, more in that which is in Christ, and in the promise, tj^ian in any thii)g which they find ^• in themselves. Rejoice, O believer, in the Lord Jesus. Make Him the consolation of thy souL Try how much of Christ, may.be enJQyedby the^-upon earth, to prepare thee for^the full, and endlesa enjoyment of him in 'heaven. Let it be thy con-** tinual study, to enjoy as much of heaven upon earth, as possible. To be in Christ, and to rejoice-in Him, are heaven below; and to be "rnith Him,f, to behold his glory, is heaven above. Trusting in, thy gracious Redeemer, who " rejoiceth over diee: to do thee good;" ask thyself, every morning,— * What have I to expect from my dear Redeemer,, this day, to afford me jqy ?' This question will,^ under the consoling influences of the holy Comforts* er, tend to make thee cheerful and thankful, at the* comoiencemeut of the day. How exhilarating will .

He will at least, this day, bring me Dearer than formerly, to the perfection of hdi* ness,. to the end of my faith, even the compleCe salvation of my soul.' Rejoice then, O bdievef, every day) and all the day: Rejoice in hope. << Hold fast the confidence, and the rejoicing of the hope, firm unto the end^ i*' and let thy whole intr, be a continued expression of grat^l praise to the Lord Jesus, for all that he hath done, is do^ ing, and will do, for thy soul.

Finally, Are some of the heirs of salvation fs-toured, in a good degree, witiisettled comfort? let them take occasion from it, to meditate Jrequently^ on that fulness of inexpressible and endless joy, into which they are soon to enter. O ! the inef* figible, the rapturous joy, into which they shall enter, when, in the liglit of glory, they shall see Jehovah and the Lamby and become perfect in faolir ness! Believer, the greatest consolation, whidi thou hffst ekijoyed, or which thou canst enjoy here, is

hat a smril drop, in comparison of thflt bcrnndfcsf ocean of eternal joy, whidi wiH overflow tby sod, in the pore regions of eternal day. O what inex-pi^esriUe, what transporting bliss, fs prepared for thee ! What a weight, what an eternal weight, whut an exceedingly exceeding, and eternal weight f)f glory, is, by redeeming grace, secured for thee! Doth not thy heart long ardently for this ? Doth it not rejoiee, and even exult, in the cheering pros^ pect of endless felicity, of inconceivable joy ? Dotfr it not iodk Vejond aQ transitory shadows, ** for tiutt blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the jgreat God, even our Saviour Jesus Christ?" O^ ** set thy afiectifm on Aings above, where Christ sitteth at the Tight, hand of God," amidst all the splendors oThis exahed statis, and ail those flaming ministers who surround his throne. By ire* guent meditation on that glorious rest, ** which re<-maineth for the people of God," thou now enterest mto rest ^; thou enjoy est more and more of holy tcanquilKty, of heavenly consolation. To rejoice in hope of the glory of God, is to experience the sweetest and purest joy; joy, which shall enable thee, to rise superior to the inordinate love of life, and to the disquieting fear of death. Consider thy death, as- that by which, thou wilt not depart oui' cf life, but rather inlo life; and expect from the, hands of thy faithful Redeemer, such living conW forts, in thy dying moments, as will raise thee a* bove the terror of death, and cause thee to triumph ^ over the darkness of the grave. Though a be* liever may have fears and conflictsrof soul, when he. i» in the near prospect of death ;; yet commonly

these are all over, before the solemn mcnnent cf death comes. Hk spiritual enemies, are usually made to be still as a stone, whilst he is passing through tlie river of death ^. Jesus our great High Priest, hath dipped his feet in those waters. The stream therefore is divided to thee, who art by feith united to him. The-channel is dry. Thou mayest discern the footsteps of thy almighty Redeemer, in the bottom, and endless felicity on the other side. Having already tasted the sweetness of pure consolation, thou shouldst long, with ardent and increasing desire, for '^ the marriage-sup* per of the Lamb." He hath by ten thousand thousand instances of kindnes», so endeared himself to thy heart, that thou shouldst not be fully satisfied, until thou have the full enjoyment of his immense and everlasting love; until thou see him as he is, enjoy the unclouded light of his countenance, and be crowned with the unfading brightness of eternal glory. Let thy present consolation, tlien, excite thee often to meditate on, and ardently ta long for, that consummate felicity which awaits jhee, in the pure regions of everlasting light, and love, and joy. For yet a little, a very little while^ and thou, ** the ransomed of the Lord shah return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon thy head: thou shalt obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away ^Z'
